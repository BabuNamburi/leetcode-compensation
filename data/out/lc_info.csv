I negotiated for almost 1 week. Initially they offered me 24L fix + 2.4L variable. When i asked if they are open for negotiating on the numbers, he said that is the best he can offer. I asked for 2 days time to think. I got a call from him 3 days after that day. It was a long 30 min call in which i asked for 10% raise on the other offer total compensation. HR firstly refused and said straight away NO but later said he will talk with the management and would get back. I got a call again after 3 days and he disclosed the above numbers :)

Other details: Didn't negotiate yet. Don't have any competing offers as all my interviews are lined up in the next few weeks. This was supposed to be my ""warm up"" interview.
But I think, this offer is good and will most probably accept.

A couple of people have commented asking about my experience, career path and advice for juniors. I'm adding some more details and my thoughts here,
In my 7 YOE, I spent 4.5 years in a very early stage no-name startup. Though I was paid less here, my learnings were huge. I was responsible for whole end to end tech stack and it helped me get so much experience which would not be possible in big companies/startups. This was the main reason I was able to clear system design interviews with ease. As I had hands-on experience in each system design aspect, I did not need much preparation for that. So, in early career, join a startup with good engineering foundation and learn. It does not matter if startup fails or succeeds, you are still very young and can try out different paths at this stage.
This is not an outlier offer. This is standard for SDE 4 and above in many companies. As you could see the breakup, stocks take up a good amount of portion. InMobi is going for IPO next year. So I belive stocks would appreciate later.
Please do proper research about market standard on bli-d and other salary discussion threads. InMobi is a good company as they did not try to low-ball me and compensated me purely based on interview feedback. I was surprised to hear this number but I got to know later from bli-d posts that this was a standard offer. If I had competing offers, this number would have gone even higher.
Before a few years, I was on the same path as most of you, reading compensation threads and wondering even if they were real. But as I progressed on my career, I came to know that these numbers are very real and they are not out of reach for anybody. Just focus on your career and the money follows.",inmobi,sde 4,7,"55,00,000 base",": 71,00,000 (with stocks)",bangalore,inmobi,sde 4,bangalore,7.0,5500000.0,7100000.0

Considering my experience and college, on't know how they can ignore all these things, and above of all when I said that it is very low considering my experience so he said that experience is not the only thing.
I said I need time I am waiting MS noida and PayPal offer but 61 is very low.
On this he tried pressurizing me by getting angry that how can you apply for 2 locations, offer for other one will be freezer and you will only have one offer. I said how can I decide on Noida's one if I don't even get to see the numbers in case it gets freezed.
On this he said that numbers will be same, I was like what he is saying. Level of interview was different, panel was different, team is different so how come the numbers will be same.
This is the way they treat candidates just to ensure that they get hired in such a low package and struggle inside to grow.
Please suggest what should I do, can it be possible that he might manipulate other offer (I had already discussed this with Noida's HR that I have just completed Hyderabad's event so can I again give the interviews on which she said yes",microsoft,se 2/l61,8+,27 lpa,": 50,52,000 lpa",hyderabad,microsoft,sde 2,hyderabad,8.0,2700000.0,5052000.0

Other Details:- I haven't accepted the offer yet, waiting for some more interviews.
What do you guys think should I make this switch?
Considering that in my current organization there is nothing bad its all chilled out, I mainly started looking out as the works is more like that of an SRE and I was and am interested in core backend development. Otherwise I don't see any cons, people are knowledgable and chilled and are concerned about work getting done and not the hours you sit(had some prior experience like this). Also in terms of WFH and flexiblity the organization is pretty chilled out. And people who have been here for 3-4 years have really grown in ladders.
The benefit I see in Hotstar is their stack is JAVA which I haven't worked in previously and I believe many companies are still mostly JAVA based. The compensation seems okay and HR told me that some Disney stocks may get included later on(no guarentee). And scale seems really good. This may help in future.
Is the compensation good enough?

Updates:
I decided to go with Adobe. I decided this because of the following reasons:
Project -- I asked both of them to setup a call with the to-be-managers so that I could have a discussion on the kind of work I'd do and the project I'd be working on. Adobe did that twice. Cohesity's HR asked me to first accept the offer. Only then they would schedule the call. I rejected their offer and the call was setup the very day.
Compensation -- Cohesity's stock value was ambiguous. Since I'm the sole earning member of the family, I wanted surity in the Covid times.
Work Life Balance -- People usually tend to burn out the initial few years in startups where there is huge learning potential, and then switch to settled companies in the later years when the pressure of raising a family comes up. However,I live at home and I didn't want to spend all the time working without having the leisure to enjoy snack and chat times with my family (this is my personal POV. I'm sure many would disagree, and I respect their opinion as well).
