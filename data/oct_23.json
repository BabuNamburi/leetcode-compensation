I carefully heard recruiter's initial offer, and negotiated it then and there. Later, after a little increase in the offer, I still asked for more time to analyse the offer and do more research. Post that, I scheduled another call to negotiate further. I am mentioning all this just to remind everyone to:\n\"Never settle for less. If you know you deserve more, simply ask. Just make sure you're respectful, polite and professional when you do so.\"",

Don't have any competing offers as all my interviews are lined up in the next few weeks. This was supposed to be my \"warm up\" interview.\nBut I think, this offer is good and will most probably accept.\n\nA couple of people have commented asking about my experience, career path and advice for juniors. I'm adding some more details and my thoughts here,\nIn my 7 YOE, I spent 4.5 years in a very early stage no-name startup. Though I was paid less here, my learnings were huge. I was responsible for whole end to end tech stack and it helped me get so much experience which would not be possible in big companies/startups. This was the main reason I was able to clear system design interviews with ease. As I had hands-on experience in each system design aspect, I did not need much preparation for that. So, in early career, join a startup with good engineering foundation and learn. It does not matter if startup fails or succeeds, you are still very young and can try out different paths at this stage.\nThis is not an outlier offer. This is standard for SDE 4 and above in many companies. As you could see the breakup, stocks take up a good amount of portion. InMobi is going for IPO next year. So I belive stocks would appreciate later.\nPlease do proper research about market standard on bli-d and other salary discussion threads. InMobi is a good company as they did not try to low-ball me and compensated me purely based on interview feedback. I was surprised to hear this number but I got to know later from bli-d posts that this was a standard offer. If I had competing offers, this number would have gone even higher.\nBefore a few years, I was on the same path as most of you, reading compensation threads and wondering even if they were real. But as I progressed on my career, I came to know that these numbers are very real and they are not out of reach for anybody. Just focus on your career and the money follows.",

Although, I mentioned during the comp call that I am in the final rounds of a couple of reputed product-based companies (two were faangs) . Probably, that helped me get a sign-on bonus and a little raise on the base\nFor stocks, they can be vested 25% per year for 4 years. 25% can be vested after the end of first year of employment with them. Thereafter, from second year onwards, can vest 6.25% each quarter (i.e. 25% for an year)\nComp is based on interview performance too\nDidn't add interview experience, please comment if anyone wants it\nQuestions :\nShould I accept this offer? Is there room for more negotiation? If yes, then in which component?\nAmazon's interviews are still pending, is it worth waiting? Personally sepaking, their 2-3 lacs increase in base is not worth the bad WLB\nDoes anyone know about the overall culture and WLB at Expedia? Would be great if you could provide some insights.\nIs the offer as per industry standards?\nEdit :\nAdded interview experience.\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-experience/1518894/Expedia-Group-or-SDE2-or-Bangalore-or-Sep-2021-or-Offer",

Otherwise I don't see any cons, people are knowledgable and chilled and are concerned about work getting done and not the hours you sit(had some prior experience like this). Also in terms of WFH and flexiblity the organization is pretty chilled out. And people who have been here for 3-4 years have really grown in ladders.\nThe benefit I see in Hotstar is their stack is JAVA which I haven't worked in previously and I believe many companies are still mostly JAVA based. The compensation seems okay and HR told me that some Disney stocks may get included later on(no guarentee). And scale seems really good. This may help in future.\nIs the compensation good enough?\nDoes the compensation seem good enough to make a switch, considering after taxes?",

I decided this because of the following reasons:\nProject -- I asked both of them to setup a call with the to-be-managers so that I could have a discussion on the kind of work I'd do and the project I'd be working on. Adobe did that twice. Cohesity's HR asked me to first accept the offer. Only then they would schedule the call. I rejected their offer and the call was setup the very day.\nCompensation -- Cohesity's stock value was ambiguous. Since I'm the sole earning member of the family, I wanted surity in the Covid times.\nWork Life Balance -- People usually tend to burn out the initial few years in startups where there is huge learning potential, and then switch to settled companies in the later years when the pressure of raising a family comes up. However,I live at home and I didn't want to spend all the time working without having the leisure to enjoy snack and chat times with my family (this is my personal POV. I'm sure many would disagree, and I respect their opinion as well).\nEdit:\nInterview experience with Microsoft here.\nInterview experiences with other companies coming up soon.",
