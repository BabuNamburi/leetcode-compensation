The thing is that I have already joined Amazon and its been 1 month and just got an offer from Expedia should I ask the recruiter for an increase in pay since Expedia is paying a lot in 2nd year. Or should i leave Expedia and continue working in Amazon?
I really need some advice on this is it wrong to ask for more after joining a firm for a month, I gave the Online Assessment before joining Amazon and out of the blue i got an email for interviews. So what should I do here?
