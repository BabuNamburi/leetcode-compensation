I have a good team at Amazon. Not sure about promotion though, as just completed 10 months.
Questions I have:
Is the offer good or there is a chance to increase it? If yes, in what areas?
Should I wait for promotion at Amazon and decline the offer at MS? I might get promoted in next 8 months or so, hopefully. Also, how is the promotion speed at MS?
Should I switch to MS and then work on getting promoted there or stay at Amazon, get promoted and then switch ?
Should I use this offer and talk to my manager at Amazon to increase Compensation ?
Thanks for all the help!
