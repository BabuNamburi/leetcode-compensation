This is inital offer, I have not nego yet.
Honestly I love my current job, however Amazon Canada is good experience and it will boost my resume. I am really confused whether I should take offer and nego or I should just prepare for US office. However I will have to apply for H1B for US, which is a lottery.
Salary is Canada is not that good and also I heard most of interesting project and smartest people are in US office.
Could you please give advice whether I should take? If yes, how much should I nego for?
