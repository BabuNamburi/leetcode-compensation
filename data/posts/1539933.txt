Hi Friends,
Need your suggestions to choose b/w Expedia SDE-2 role and Dp world SDE-1 role.
YOE : 3Years
College : Tier1/TIer2
Previous company - 2 product based Org.
Expedia : 25lpa base + 4lpa Joining Bonus +13lpa rsu(25% for 4 years)
DP world : 30 base + 6 variable
Considering work culture and Brand name , i am more inclined towards Expedia. So Can i ask them to increase my base a bit after accepting the offer?
Please suggest
