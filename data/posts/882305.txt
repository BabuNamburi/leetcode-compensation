I applied on their website through the Grace Hopper conference. I was reached out to a few days later by a recruiter, and then moved on to speak with a hiring manager that grilled me with behavioral questions for a full hour. After that, I was instructed to take a caliper assessment and, after I passed that, was given an offer letter the next day. No live coding, hardly any technical questions aside from "tell me about some of your projects."
