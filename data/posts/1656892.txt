Current Company : Startup
Current Salary: 17.5L ( 17 fixed + 50k variable)
Years of experience: 3.6
Offered Company: Arcesium
Designation: SSE
Compensation: 28-28.5 LPA ( 23 fixed + 2-2.5 variable + 3 LPA LTA for 4 years)
I feel its low ball. I asked to increase base to 26 but they are not ready for that)
I showed my numbers to my current company and they ready to retain and they proposed revised offer 28LPA ( 24 base + 4 variable 100% )
i joined in startup 8 months back itself but due to low work i applied for new opportunities but they asked me to stay and shifted to good work project.
So should I stay in the company and grow for some time then apply for new company or accept arcesium offer and find another company during notice period of 2 months for better pay?
Valuable suggestions welcome
