I recently got PPO from Morgan Stanley after the completion of my 2 months summer internship. I am very happy about everything that this company has to offer.
But I am not sure which would be good for starting my career, whether an Investment Bank like MS or some other Product Based company that I should try. And if there are any pros and cons that I should be aware of being a software engineer at an Investment Bank.
