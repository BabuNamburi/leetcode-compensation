Hi,
I have got the following offer from BharatPe Delhi :
Compensation Details:
Education: B.Tech In CSE from Tier 1 College
Years of Experience: 2.4 yrs
Current Company : SDE 2 at one of the good companies.
Title/Level: SDE3
Location: Delhi
Base Salary: 36L
Signing Bonus: NA
Stock bonus: 16L equal distribution for 4 years.
Total compensation First year compensation - 40LPA
Current TC: 32LPA + 16L stocks(4 years distribution)
Should i consider switching? Appraisals at my current company is very good, good WLB, great appraisals. Also by next appraisal (mid next year) compensation will likely surpass BharatPe offer by similar difference ~ 4LPA?
Also i heard people getting 50 ~ 70LPA at Bharatpe, is that true and should i try to negotiate?
Interview Process

Second round with CTO asking basic CS/Backend questions
and then tells the comp in same call.
