PS: Currently in negotiation with DTDL HR for the best offer. I was really hoping for at least 18 LPA CTC but HRs are not budging an inch :( Also this CTC breakup is very weird. Last working day is 19th August. In talks with MMT HR if any position opens which is on hold. Will discuss with current employer also for the best.
Please suggest what should I do and where to join and any CTC number that I should quote in my next interview if any.
