What do you guys think should I make this switch?
Considering that in my current organization there is nothing bad its all chilled out, I mainly started looking out as the works is more like that of an SRE and I was and am interested in core backend development. Otherwise I don't see any cons, people are knowledgable and chilled and are concerned about work getting done and not the hours you sit(had some prior experience like this). Also in terms of WFH and flexiblity the organization is pretty chilled out. And people who have been here for 3-4 years have really grown in ladders.
The benefit I see in Hotstar is their stack is JAVA which I haven't worked in previously and I believe many companies are still mostly JAVA based. The compensation seems okay and HR told me that some Disney stocks may get included later on(no guarentee). And scale seems really good. This may help in future.
Is the compensation good enough?
Does the compensation seem good enough to make a switch, considering after taxes?
