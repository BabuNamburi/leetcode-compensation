Hi,
I recently got 2 offers: Amazon L6 and Meta E5.
The total compensations are very similar. The role at Amazon is under its Fulfillment Technology & Robotic group, and the role at Meta is to do AR/VR related development.
Can I get some suggestions which role should I choose? I am currently a full time employee at another big company.
Thank you so much for any suggestion you provide.
