First round was a test which consists of two parts:
Aptitude
Coding questions(2 questions - easy and medium)
Second round was interview round, and it was a technical+HR round.
After that, I got the mail that I've been selected. I was told to upload documents on the portal for BGV(background verification)
After BGV, I got the offer letter, and CTC is INR 3,50,000 per year.
