✅ Step 1: Read and understand the problem statement
Take the time to read it carefully and make sure you understand what the problem is asking for.
Identify the input and output, constraints, and any special requirements.
Resources:
Online coding forums and communities such as Stack Overflow, Reddit, and Quora.
Tools:
Code editors such as Visual Studio Code or Atom for writing and editing code.
Ex: Let's consider an example where we need to write a program to find the longest common prefix in an array of strings.
✅ Step 2: Analyze the problem and break it down
Try to Break it down into smaller, more manageable parts.
Identify the sub-problems, inputs, and outputs, and make a plan to solve each one individually.
Ex: We can break down the problem into finding the common prefix between two strings and then recursively finding the common prefix of all strings in the array.
✅ Step 3: Choose the right data structure and algorithm
Based on the problem statement and the sub-problems identified in the previous step, select the appropriate data structure and algorithm to solve each sub-problem.
Use your knowledge of data structures and algorithms to choose the most efficient one.
Resources:
LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces to practice and improve your skills.
Ex: In the longest common prefix example, we can use a Trie to store the prefixes of all strings in the array and find the longest common prefix by traversing the Trie.
✅ Step 4: Implement the solution
Write the code for each sub-problem, test it, and make sure it works as expected.
Once you have implemented the solution for all sub-problems, combine them to get the final solution for the problem statement.
Tools:
Code editors such as VSCode or Sublime Text
Ex: In the longest common prefix example, we can implement the solution using Python and the Trie data structure.
✅ Step 5: Test and optimize the solution
The final step is to test and optimize the solution.
Test the solution with different inputs and edge cases to make sure it works for all scenarios.
Identify any performance issues and optimize the solution if needed.
Resources:
Testing frameworks such as JUnit or NUnit to automate testing
Profiling tools such as VisualVM or Xcode Instruments to identify performance bottlenecks.
Tools:
Debuggers such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code for identifying and fixing.
