[I am a senior QA having experience of 6 years and I got an offer from
Airtel Africa (product based)
Time Internet (product based)
Global Logic (service-based).
All these three companies are offering quite a similar amount between 26-27 LPA.
Please help me, which company should I have to join?
My joining is scheduled on tomorrow
Edit: I am not getting why people downvoting this question.??
I just asked for a suggestion from the community.
If you don't have any suggestion to mention then atleast please don't downvote post
