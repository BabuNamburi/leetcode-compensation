Compensation wise I'm aligned since I've decided to move out of current org. I'm getting decent raise over fixed component and with negotiation will try to push further.
I wish to have future role aligning with my current skillset e.g. Building Java Backend distributed systems. I'm looking forward to a role having good learning scope and decent WLB unlike aggressive indian startups.
Anyone working at wayfair or aware of it, please give me reviews about Marketing Tech engg team, tech, culture and WLB at Wayfair. Also I've heard about PHP used across systems and migration/revamps going on in Wayfair, does it hold for marketing tech too?
Thanks
