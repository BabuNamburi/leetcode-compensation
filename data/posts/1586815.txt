Suggestion required! (old)
I currently have another offer at hand with a startup with ~60L fixed plus some stocks which I got after cracking Twilio. Though startup has the money, given the brand, I am inclined towards joining Twilio. Should I re-negotiate with Twilio based on the package that the startup is giving me? Is there enough room for negotiation? Whats the maximum I can get in L3? Please guide!
Update (new)
Got offer from Microsoft with better CTC, so dropped this offer.
