Other Details :
Negotiate better, I didn't have any competing offer so couldn't negotiate. Although, I mentioned during the comp call that I am in the final rounds of a couple of reputed product-based companies (two were faangs) . Probably, that helped me get a sign-on bonus and a little raise on the base
For stocks, they can be vested 25% per year for 4 years. 25% can be vested after the end of first year of employment with them. Thereafter, from second year onwards, can vest 6.25% each quarter (i.e. 25% for an year)
Comp is based on interview performance too
Didn't add interview experience, please comment if anyone wants it
Questions :
Should I accept this offer? Is there room for more negotiation? If yes, then in which component?
Amazon's interviews are still pending, is it worth waiting? Personally sepaking, their 2-3 lacs increase in base is not worth the bad WLB
Does anyone know about the overall culture and WLB at Expedia? Would be great if you could provide some insights.
Is the offer as per industry standards?
Edit :
Added interview experience.
