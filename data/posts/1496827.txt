P.S: Can't share exact interview questions, but the topics covered were similar to any UI interview in companies like Amazon, Phonepe, Swiggy, Microsoft:
JS fundamentals like execution context, closure, prototypal inheritance, event loop, some questions from typescript, and machine coding(where you have to build a working web app on the given problem statement within 1-2 hrs) and web fundamentals from html, css, networks. CP is not required for UI/frontend interviews, rather JS specific DSA questions are asked like traversing and manipulating DOM tree and likes of that.
P.S 2: I don't mean CP is bad or not useful, it's just not needed for UI interviews, but yes if you are applying for SDE backend role, CP will surely be helpful there.
