I recently applied for the Associate Software Engineer role at Accenture through my campus placement. The application process involved an online examination comprising sections on Quantitative Aptitude, Logical Reasoning, Verbal Ability, and two coding questions of easy to medium difficulty. Upon successfully clearing the first round, I proceeded to the second round, which was a language test. After successfully passing this round, I received an interview call.
During the interview, the interviewer began by asking about my background and introduced myself. The questions primarily focused on my previous internship experience and projects. Additionally, the interviewer posed questions related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Database Management Systems (DBMS), basic computer fundamentals, and Java-specific inquiries.
Thanks.
