Current Company - Airtel Digital
Current Compensation - 16LPA
YOE - 3.5
I have a counter offer from Agoda
Compensation Offering - 24LPA(all fixed along with bonus at end of every year)
I have a confusion that am I being low balled here since I have my appraisal in my current company in upcoming month?
Will it be worth switching on this compensation.?
