Should I join Tekion or Licious ? if Yes Which one to be specific
Priority :
Growth .(i want to switch to FAANGM after 6 months as SDE-2 )
work life balance
Brand Value (so that i can easily get calls from FAANGM)
I am in dilemma weather to Join either of these 2 companies OR to keep looking for Further offers from good Companies (swiggy , Hotstar , Flipkart , UBER ,Gojek ...)
Pros of Staying till i get good offer :
WLB - wlb is good i get time to prepare for interviews
I can try for better startups/companies
Cons: ( if I Reject all the offers)
As In my Team @Samsung no growth is present . Not working in any dev Projects .just Testing work . It would get difficut for me to switch later . As other companies would ask in interview about the work/proj. i have been working on
As YOE increases applying for SDE-1 for say 1.7 yoe is not good bcoz most of my peers would be fresh grads. (I won't be able to get SDE-2 bcoz of lack of exposure to high scale industry projects). in that case i would have to wait for at least 3+ years as most of my peers to switch as SDE-2
Guys Any Referrals to top MNCs/ startups and advice/ suggestions is much appreciated.
