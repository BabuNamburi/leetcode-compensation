Received offers from Facebook, and Amazon. Google went into hiring freeze. My negotiation "strategy" was to be very open and honest with all recruiters, keeping them informed about what everyone else was saying.
Facebook's initial offer was similar but $300,000 in stock.
Amazon gave me an SDE1 offer for $215k, so I declined that offer.
Negotiated with Facebook once and they increased stock to 350k.
