Updates:
I decided to go with Adobe. I decided this because of the following reasons:
Project -- I asked both of them to setup a call with the to-be-managers so that I could have a discussion on the kind of work I'd do and the project I'd be working on. Adobe did that twice. Cohesity's HR asked me to first accept the offer. Only then they would schedule the call. I rejected their offer and the call was setup the very day.
Compensation -- Cohesity's stock value was ambiguous. Since I'm the sole earning member of the family, I wanted surity in the Covid times.
Work Life Balance -- People usually tend to burn out the initial few years in startups where there is huge learning potential, and then switch to settled companies in the later years when the pressure of raising a family comes up. However,I live at home and I didn't want to spend all the time working without having the leisure to enjoy snack and chat times with my family (this is my personal POV. I'm sure many would disagree, and I respect their opinion as well).
Edit:
Interview experience with Microsoft here.
Interview experiences with other companies coming up soon.
