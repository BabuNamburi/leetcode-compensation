Amazon offer came after MSFT, so I contacted recruiter to negotiate but found her too unprofessional in her job.I rejected the MSFT offer.I have heard similar stories where MSFT is not able to pay well.Not sure whats happening with them currently as they are not able to match other product companies offers.\nStill thinking about Amazon offer. I read that Amazon has URA where they force 5% of employees even if they perform well.Can some one from Banglore India help if the URA/PIP culture is too bad at Amazon?"}
