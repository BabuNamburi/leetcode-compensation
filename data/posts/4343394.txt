Hi everyone,
I have finished the technical rounds and hr round in Walmart referral drive and expecting an offer in couple of days.
Education: Btech , Top NIT
Total experience: 3 years
Current CTC: 33 LPA (27 fixed + 6 variable)
Ex company: Early stage Startup
I said that I am expecting 30% hike on my base pay when asked about salary expectations with the walmart hr. He took the inputs and said they will get back.
I have gone through walmart compensations in leetcode and found that for IN3 they are usually offering 25-28 base (29 is the one exception I have seen out of 50 compensations for IN3)
I am not so sure how can i negotiate better as i have already heard from people that usually hr says "This is the slab we have and we can't offer more" even when showed with much higher competing offers ctc.
Is there any room for negotitations?
or any inside outs how how much walmart can offer for IN3 roles?
Thanks for reading this post and your responses are much appreciated!!!!!!!!
Update:
Got the offer from Walmart.
Base: 28
PF: 1.3
Stocks: 25% base vested over 3 years
Variable: 20% of base
Total Ctc: 37 LPA
When i tried to negotiate more on base, then the hr said, this is the best they can offer. Hr literally said, if you are okay with it, let me roll out the offer letter, if not let's not proceed further.
Then I asked atleast give me some Joining Bonus, then she is like "No".
Since I don't have any other offer, I couldn't ask more. Accepted the offer.
Thanks LC community for the comments and continous support _/_
