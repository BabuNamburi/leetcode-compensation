A horror story with Stanza Living
no benefits whatsoever
They have fired already 50% of Tech and Product Team
let's start from the beginning
Strictly work from office with strict timing from 9:30 AM
every after two hours they will ask if is it done. is it done?
you are supposed to be in the office upto 8-9 PM on normal days and 10-11 Pm on release week and available anytime
they can fire anyone anytime if you ever disagree with their decisions
they define the expected timeline of the feature not the developers
they just give orders like I want this feature by tomorrow (sometime by today EOD)
I think its good to be unemployed rather than working here
very toxic work culture just one good thing every developer is willing to help each other
just ask any developer either who left or currently working ,they will tell you their horror story
every day i eat medicine for headache before going to sleep
