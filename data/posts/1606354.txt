Suggestion for leadership principles preparation
Pick 3 projects, where you had to do a lot of stuff
Think about all end-user interactions that you predicted and added to behaviour
Think about new thing learnt (use it if they ask you about challenges you faced)
Think about things that no-one asked you to do, but you did (extra delight)
These will cover most of their principles,
and even if there question is a bit different
if -> you can't think of relevant points, and interviewer is junior
just say these points, they will be happy and pass you.
