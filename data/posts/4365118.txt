Hi all,
I am reaching out to you for an extensive discussion about the sources of information for compensation survey. Most platforms like glassdoor, ambitionbox, levels.fyi, etc have been flooded with fake reviews and compensation info from the HRs, recruiters and other persons of influence for very obvious reasons.
Hence there is the need for authentic data on compensations for companies, profiles, industries, domains and skillsets, etc. So let's use this platform to share some authentic platforms for sharing compensation data, interview experiences, etc.
This outreach will help thousands of us to negotiate better.
