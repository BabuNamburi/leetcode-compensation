Sorry to Post this in Compensation Section. But need advice as soon as Possible
I am a new graduate and doing 6 month (Jan - Jun) internship in a company (say,X). The interning company told that internhip to full time will be on performance basis. (Will be announed in the month of Jan or Jun)
I also have only full-time offer from another company say Y (starting from july). This company has sent out it's legal offer letter out (so soon though) and gave a week of time to accept it. Now if I accept this offer letter from company Y, can I reject this offer in later point of time? (if i get a full time offer from my interning company X.)
What could be the legal actions, if i reject the company Y, after signing offer letter now and rejecting it in the month of Jun or July. (Also don't wanna take risk by rejecting company Y's offer lettter now)
P.S: 1) Company X (interning company) Total Compensation >> Company Y total compensation
2) In the terms of contract there's nothing mentioned regarding voluntary termination of contract before joining date (i.e rejecting the offer letter after accepting).
