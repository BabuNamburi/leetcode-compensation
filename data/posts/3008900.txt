This was quite a low ball for an EM that too in Banaglore, tried to negotiate but they have a strict budget so rejected the offer. The HR kept on saying that the co-founder really liked me and wanted to have me on-board. One thing i don't understand is if they are really keen to have me on-board then they should not restrict themselves on the budget as candidate's expectation are discussed beforehand, no point in giving ctc below their expectation.
