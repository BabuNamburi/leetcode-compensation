YOE: 4.5
College: Tier 2
Prev Compensation: 18 Lakhs Base + 1 lakh Variable + 2.5 Lakhs Share (to be vested in 3 years)
This company is a pre-ipo unicorn.
New Compensation:
Base: 27 Lakhs
Joining Bonus: 1.5 Lakhs
Shares: 5000 units to be vested in 4 years. This is pre-ipo. In grey market current price is $20
Retention Bonus: 1.5 Lakhs at first year, 3 Lakhs in second year.
Overall 1 year compensation: 27 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 30 lakhs.
1 year share price = 1250 * 20 * 70 INR = 17.5 Lakhs
= 47.5 Lakhs.
My question is, are pre-ipo shares worth it? If I want to leave after an year I will have to buy the share at $10 strike rate which would mean my total benefit would be 7~8 lakhs every year which makes my total comp around 35 lakhs an year. Also there is no guarantee when the IPO would be.
Is this a decent offer?
