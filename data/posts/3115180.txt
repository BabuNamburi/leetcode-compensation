What is TypeScript?
Microsoft created and maintains TypeScript, an object-oriented programming language.
It's a syntactical superset of JavaScript with the addition of optional static typing.
TypeScript can be used to create JavaScript applications that run on
both the server and the client. The most popular TypeScript programs are also JavaScript
programs.
What is JavaScript?
JavaScript, shortened as JS, is a scripting language that follows the ECMAScript
standard. JavaScript is a just-in-time compiled language with a high level of abstraction
and multi-pattern support.
JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with web pages and is
a necessary component of web applications
Although JavaScript engines were once only found in web browsers, they are now used
on a wide range of servers, most notably via Node.js. JavaScript derivatives include
TypeScript, CoffeeScript, Dart, and Kotlin
Why Use TypeScript?
Typescript is a superset of JavaScript. This means Typescript is a combination of
JavaScript and a few more characteristics. Developers will find it easier to work with
JavaScript due to the language.
Here are some more instances of what TypeScript is used for:
Improve IDE Support:
TypeScript development is a significant improvement over JavaScript development.
Atom, Sublime, Visual Studio Code, and WebStorm are just a few of the JavaScript
IDEs that offer excellent support for both TypeScript and JavaScript.
Interoperability:
TypeScript is strongly linked to JavaScript. As a result, it has high interoperability
capabilities, although it requires some additional work to work with JS libraries in
TypeScript.
Static Typing:
JavaScript is tightly typed, so it doesn't know what kind of variable it's dealing with
until it's practically created at runtime. JavaScript now has type support due to
TypeScript.
Strict Null Examination:
In JavaScript software programming, errors, like cannot to read property 'x' of
undefined, are common. Since a variable that is unknown to the TypeScript compiler
cannot be used, you can avoid most of these errors.
Supports New ECMAScript:
-TypeScript can trans-pile unique ECMAScript criteria to ECMAScript objectives of
your choice. As a result, you can use lambda, modules, functions, the spread
operator, de-structuring, and classes, which are all features of ES2015 and beyond.
Type Inference:
The use of type inference in TypeScript makes typing easier and less confusing. Even
if you don't use the interface, TypeScript can help you avoid mistakes that could
cause runtime issues.
Why Use JavaScript?
JavaScript is in high demand these days, as it is supported by the majority of browsers
and web-based applications. In addition to the web, it's utilized in servers, applications,
and embedded hardware controllers.
The following are some basic reasons why designing a JavaScript application is
preferable:
Foundational Language :
The event-driven software design style organizes the movement of your code by
system events or user events, and JavaScript supports it.
Fun and Interactive Language :
You'll have immediate access to a complete user interface. JavaScript has a
graphical user interface that is both entertaining and simple to use. Early in the
learning process, you can construct browser-based scripts to create interactive
projects.
Learning Support :
Each browser has to source code viewing features that allow you to learn from the
live coding of others. In addition, JavaScript has the largest and most dynamic
library code repository in the ecosystem. Individuals in the JavaScript community
are extremely helpful and active in sharing and repurposing one another's code.
Low Requirements to Start :
Browsers use a programming language called JavaScript. It's a lot simpler to
understand, and you can get started right away. Unlike other languages, JavaScript
does not require you to install a large number of programs before you can begin
using it.
Rich Interfaces :
To provide a rich interface to your website users, you can use JavaScript to include
features like sliders and drag-and-drop components.
Superior Debugging Tools :
The web browser has a collaborative JavaScript interpreter that allows you to
explore and receive immediate feedback, allowing you to learn more quickly.
** Conclusion:
After reviewing all of the information presented in this article, we can conclude that both
languages have advantages and disadvantages.
TypeScript is designed for developers who desire to write understandable, well-
organized code. We're not even going to mention what TypeScript has to provide, such as
live-bug checking and static typing.
Although JavaScript is not a complete programming language, it can be used in
combination with HTML to improve web page quality. You'll also find a lot of seasoned
engineers who know how to code in JavaScript.
