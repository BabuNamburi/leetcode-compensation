Hi All,
I have two offers:
Daimler Truck - 11.5 LPA (10.7 fixed)
TechMojo Solutions - 14 LPA (12.6 fixed)
Culture and learning wise both are good but work-life balance is more in Daimler and also it is hybrid mode n Daimler while it is 5 days WFO in Techmojo.
If anyone wants to share their thoughts or want to give advice, they are welcome.
Thanks in advance!
