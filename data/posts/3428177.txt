Hii all,
I am in a situation and unable to find what should i do, but I feel this situation will come in most of the people's career so why not discuss this here.
I am currently working in a startup as sde-1 from past 1.10 years and my promotion is in next 2 months to sde-2.
My current Compensation
Fixed salary:- 25lpa
Bonus:- 5lpa
TC:- 30lpa
Expected TC after promotion
Fixed salary:- 34lpa
Bonus:- 6lpa
TC:- 40lpa
I am expected to get a offer from a known startup but they are offering me SDE-1 kinda role but the compensation is on higher level.
Expected TC from new company
Fixed salary :- 37lpa
Joining Bonus :- 5lpa
Performance Bonus:- 10-15% of base ( = 4lpa approx)
Unlisted Stocks :- worth 20lakhs yearly but unlisted
TC:- 66lpa
But this compensation is for SDE-1.I was expecting SDE-2 but they can not offer sde-2 position to me as of now, so what's your call on this? Should i accept this offer but it will take 2 more years to get SDE-2.
