{"text": "Education: BS Computing Science\nYears of Experience: 10+\nPrior Experience: Senior Software Engineer at a great company\nCompany: Amazon\nTitle/Level: SDE2 (L5)\nLocation: Vancouver\nSalary: 130,000\nSigning Bonus: CAD 28,000 first year. CAD 26,000 second year.\nStock bonus: 51 units over 4 years (stocks over 4 years split as 5%, 15%, 40%, 40%)\nTotal comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): CAD 159,000 first year + stocks later\nI love my current job and I have great work life balance. Honestly I'm not sure if i should take it. I told recruiter no and this is not what I want so she's gonna adjust maybe bonus a bit but won't be too much different than what it is now.\nSalary is not much higher so I'm really doubting. Only reason I would join is to have it on my resume for future potential of getting hired. Driving me crazy not sure if i should accept but leaning towards yes even though my current job is amazing."}
