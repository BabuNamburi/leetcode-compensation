I was asked to design and explain a system similar to playo app. Enabling users to book ground for sports and fun activities. While I was able to design the system properly and provide an explanation of my thought process, I felt that the interviewer had difficulty understanding my explanation regarding how schemaless db is better as we dont need to join if i am selecting a sub area in a city and in that sub areas there can be multiple playgrounds.
I want to note that the interview process was fair and professional, and the interviewer did ask relevant and thought-provoking questions. However, I felt that there may have been a communication breakdown during the discussion of the NoSQL database component of the system.
Any way tough luck.
