Experience of Job Hunt after Layoff
I was being laid off from my previous company. From past 2.5 months I've applied over 1000 jobs across all job searching platforms liked LinkedIn, Naukri.com, Instahyre, Indeed, Wellfound and many more. I was barely able to get 3 calls which were turned into an interview. I got rejected from the other 2s and after all this I got this one job at a very young firm in India. But they are offering a pay which is very low on comparison to my previous pay. They are offering me a total compensation of 12 LPA (11 Base+ 1 Variable). I know it is standard for a fresher but at same time it is almost half of my previous comp.
Doubt
I'm in doubt of joining because once I'll join I can switch only after 8-12 months only otherwise it won't look good in resume. So after that time I'll be offered based on 11 which will put me in back foot. But if I'll wait I can't gaurantee that within 2-4 months I'll be able to get another offer with atleast 15 TC, since job market is extremely tough right now. No interviews lined up no call from any firm. It's just plain dead.
