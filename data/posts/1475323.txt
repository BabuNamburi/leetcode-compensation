I know Flipkart, Ola, OYO, etc give a bunch a stock options, but are they worth anything, if these companies don't IPO? I can't remember the last time an Indian tech startup IPO'ed. I know stock ownership depends on the company policy; some companies have single trigger (your stocks have to vest), and some double trigger (single trigger + you have to be an employee). If it's a double trigger, your stocks are almost worthless if the company has no plans in the next 3-5 years. And it's hard to get these insights unless you're on the board of directors. HR, Hiring Manager are too low in the corporate chain to give you any useful information.
Forgive my lack of awareness, or misinformation, if anything I've said is inaccurate. Any insights are useful. Thanks
