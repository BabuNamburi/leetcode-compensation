Been going through the posts here, the difference in the SDE 1 compensations for Amazon India is striking. Can someone please shed some light?
It appears that the lofty packages are PPOs, after an internship at Amazon. If so, are 2 month summer interns treated the same as the 6 month interns?
Thank you.
