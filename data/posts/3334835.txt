I'm Writing this review after Considering Important Facts here
On the positive side, the company has a great team of employees who are dedicated and hardworking.
However, I have noticed that there are some issues with work-life balance at the company. There have been times when I have been asked to work long hours and in night without adequate compensation or recognition. This has led to some burnout and stress among employees.
Additionally, there could be more growth opportunities and policies in place to support employees' professional development. While there are some training programs available, they are not always well-organized or tailored to individual needs.
This created a stressful and unsustainable work environment, which ultimately led to high levels of employee burnout and turnover.
There have been some concerns raised about micromanagement by certain managers. This can be frustrating and demotivating for employees who would like more autonomy in their work.
Overall, while there were some positive aspects to working at FOX, the company's work-life balance, growth opportunities, and micromanagement policies were significant areas of concern. I would recommend that the company take a more proactive approach to address these issues to better support their employees and improve the overall work environment.

The company also had a poor workplace culture, with rampant favoritism.
All Directors from India are BUllshit they will humiliate you they will scold you , they will do anything they want and this make the place even worse since they are playing role of Managers as well in projects and managers simply listen and do what they says managers have no choice . I witnessed numerous instances of bullying and harassment, but when I reported these incidents to HR, nothing was done. It was clear that the company prioritized protecting its image over the well-being of its employees.
A huge issue with promotion is people have more experiance and are working under fewer experiance people
Apart from that :

free Linkedin Learning course
few projects have legacy code (5+ years old )
Home setup types of equipment i.e. monitor table, earpods, mouse keyboard
people who knows politics and have suger in their voice can really do greate here.
