Hi,
I got below 2 offers from these companies:
Education: B.Tech in ECE (Tier 3) + PG Diploma from CDAC
Years of Experience: 3 years (1.3 year service based non dev + 1.10 dev product based)
Prior Experience: 1 years 10 months in Product based company
Previous salary: 11.45 Lakhs CTC (11 fixed + 0.45 variable)
Date of the Offer: July 2023
Company: Deutsche Telekom Digital Labs
Title/Level: Software Engineer
Location: Gurgaon (Hybrid work)
Salary: 14.5 lakhs all fixed
Joining Bonus: 1 lakhs 
Total comp (Salary + Bonus): 15.5 lakhs
Benefits: Unlimited leaves + Mobile phone bill reimbursement upto INR 2K per month + Cult.fit gym membership + Mobile handset upto INR 20k

** Accepted this as of now. ** 
** Will also negotiate from my current company for SDE-2 & 18 Lakhs CTC. Any advise will be highly valuable. **

Note: Although I asked for 16 Lakhs (15 + 1) as CTC but HR said I will get counter offer from my current company or outside so they are offering this as of now. 
But they are willing to reach this CTC 2-3 days prior to joining them. They even offered to buyout my notice period and give the same.

PS: Revised offer from 13.5 to 14.5 fixed.
Date of the Offer: July 2023
Company: eShopBox
Title/Level: Software Engineer - 1
Location: Gurgaon (Fulltime office)
Salary: INR 12.26 lakhs fixed
Performance bonus: INR 50K
Retention Bonus: INR 50K
Total comp (Salary + Bonuses): INR 13.5 Lakhs

Note: Declined this because they lowballed plus its only SDE-1 and the last interviewer was rude and asking irrelevant questions. 
Didn't feel good about the company & company culture.
PS: I know my current salary is very low as per my experience but that's what it is. Tier 3 issues of from where you start your journey + market recession at wrong time. Any advice would be appreciated. Still have more interviews lined up so let's see :)
