I have cleared all the rounds only the salary discussion is left.
my current ctc is 4 lpa and i have expierence of 1.8 years.
I have asked around and i know that 12 lpa is the average base there but they usually give on the basis of previous ctc.
I dont have any others offers as of now, so how should i negotiate and get maximum?
Pleaseeee help me out...
