Reposting it for you suggestions :-
Current CTC: (27L Fixed + 2.7L variable + 10L/ 3 years RSUs)
YOE: 3.5+
Offer :-
fixed base : 43L INR
JB :6.5L INR
RB: 8L (paid quarterly 2L each quarter) INR
Stocks: 18L / 4 Years(10%, 20%, 30% 40%)
First Year total(LB + RB + fixed + stocks) : 6.5L + 8L + 43 + 1.8 = INR 59.3L
Second Year : 43 + 3.6L = INR 46.6L (if No hike).
