I'm currently in my big tech company working for 100k pounds per year on a perm basis, What should I do with this role? This is a inside IR35 contract which mean I will be giving away 45% as taxes. Should I risk taking the role, will it be a big beef up for my CV to work in BNP? my pay raise monthly will be 1200 pounds. Or should I keep working as I work in my comfortable Big tech company.
