Hi,
I have got the following offer from AWS Bangalore :
Compensation Details:

Years of Experience: 8+
Prior Experience:
Current Company: Adobe, Bangalore
Title: Computer Scientist
Company: AWS
Title/Level: SDE2
Location: Bangalore
Base Salary: 39L

Stock bonus: 26 units (4 yr vesting)
Total compensation First year compensation - 77L first year (avg 74L per year for 4 years, not considering appraisals)

I am not sure how good this offer is, I am being offered SDE2 which is bothering me a little. Please let me know if you think i am being lowballed, given that appraisals are due 2 months from now. Also, i have not heard good things about Amazon, is AWS culture wise bad in general?
Thanks
