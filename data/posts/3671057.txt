I have 1 year of experience in an early stage fintech startup.
I specialise in Spring Boot,
I can build spring boot applications all the way from the scratch and scale it to millions of users alone.
I have the entire idea of deployment pipeline.
My current CTC is 9lpa.
I want to switch out, what should be the ideal ctc i should not settle below seeing the current layoff situation ?
