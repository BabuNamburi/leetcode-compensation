I interviewed at Walmart For Backened Engineer role and I cleared all the rounds. How much should I ask hike to HR.
I dont the know the position they were offering but it was for 3-7 years experience.
There were 2 Technical Rounds and 1 HM Round.
Current Exp- 3.9
Current City - Pune
My current TC - 16.5 (Fixed) + Bonus (1 lakh)
I dont have any offer in hand now.
How much should I expect from Walmart as I will be moving to Banglore for the first time?
Please advice. It would be really helpful.
