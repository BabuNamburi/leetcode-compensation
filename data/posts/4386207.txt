Hi folks,
I had all 4 rounds of onsite interviews 10 days back.
Recruiter told me that she would get back to me within 2-3 days.
checked with her last week, she told that she was still awaiting feedback from interviews.
Checked with her 2 days before, she kept on telling the same thing that she was still awaiting results from interviewers.
Its been 10 days, since I completed all 4 onsite rounds.
Do interviewers take that long to update feedback?
or they are interiviewing other canditates parallely or making excuses?
Really worried as I worked very hard and all my rounds went very well.
