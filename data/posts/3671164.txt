Did I get good justification to my title bump? I am feeling like I am low-balled as the each year appraisals will be very less and since I am SDE-2 now, I won't be getting promotions also. What should I do? I don't want to do frequent switches. I was anxious because of layoff and hence joined.
Someone from Jio could please confirm if I have been low-balled? Also, what possible options I can go for?
