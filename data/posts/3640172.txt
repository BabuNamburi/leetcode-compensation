Education: Currently in 3rd year B.Tech Program at one of the old IITs
Prior Experience: Global Alpha Researcher at Trexquant
Company: Trexquant
Title/Level: Quantitative Research Intern
Location: Gurugram, India
Stipend: INR 3,20,000(~$4000) per month
Duration : 8 Weeks (2 Months) Summer Internhsip
Other Offers : I had an offer to join an HFT based out of Gurugram for a Tech Role, but Stipend was lesser than what's offered here.
I have been working at Trexquant as a Global Alpha Researcher and like the work and the inclusive culture of the firm, so I decided to intern here this summer. I was offered the Intern role based on my performance in the Global Alpha Researcher(GAR) Role. The Internship role and the GAR role are very similar wrt to the the work/projects assigned and also compensation wise. I have even seen my fellow GARs make more than the above mentioned stipend, since there is a huge performance based component. The major difference is that the GAR role is remote and one can work from anywhere, whereas for the Internship we need to be present in the firm's Office in Cybercity Gurugram.
Reasons for Accepting the Offer :
As GARs we get complete ownership of the work we do, and firm recogonises the efforts and rewards the top performers with monetary awards regularly.
The mentorship and feedback provided by the senior management is a big upside of working here. The upper management(even the CEO) is very easily approachable to discuss innovative ideas and trade them in live markets.
The stipend I feel is at par with the top HFTs and is more than what peers like Worldquant offer to Summer Interns.
