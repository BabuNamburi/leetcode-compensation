I have around 2.4 years of experience in Backend technologies - Java, Python.
Currently in Bangalore. No Barrier on location
I wanted to switch - how much CTC I should expect?
Currently it's around 11 LPA (9.5 fixed + 1.5 variable). Current company given bi-yearly hike and there can be 15% average hike each time. approx(~33% per year)
Currently having offer from MakeMyTrip SSE-1 for 22 LPA (20 fixed + 1 Relocation + 1 Joining). Which companies can beat this offer for mentioned experience.?
How much Zeta/Hotstar/Intuit/Paypal pays for that much years of experience?
Also if you aware of any good startup/poduct based companies, please comment it.
