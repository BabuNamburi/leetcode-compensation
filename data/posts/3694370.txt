Received a lowball offer where the base salary is 25% lower than my forecasted budget/range. This new offer's base is only 17% higher than my original base, also they reduced the bonus to 10% which is pretty much the same CTC .
I tried to negotiate for higher base salary, but the HR said this is the maximum they can offer for this position. I'm a bit bummed, because in my current company there is no hike and growth due to poor business. However, the salary is just way too low, to the point that it's kind of a becoming a dealbreaker.
Do you guys have any tips on how to navigate this situation? Should I decline the offer? Or should I resign and search for better offer in my notice period?
