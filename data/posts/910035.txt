In terms of the interview, there was a behavioral interview (use STAR format), technical interview (3 questions, one design question, two LC easy/med in 1 hour), and case study. Capital One uses the same ~20 questions for their technical interviews, so you can find those online, and there's probably a few different case studies you could get. Mine regarded a company acquisition Capital One had acquired back around 2011, and I was asked questions about the reasons why Capital One might have acquired that company as well as what challenges there were in integrating them to Capital One.
