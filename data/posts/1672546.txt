Whilst there doesnt seem to be any discussion around job offers in UAE, I was wondering if Leetcode community could help me getting the following offer evaluated:
Exp:
7+ yoe from Tier 1 college
Current Compensation:
60 LPA(57Fixed+3Variable), ESOPs worth 20Lacs (4 years)
Dubai Job Offer:
AED 26k/mon (Remote)
AED 30k/mon (On-site, mid 2022)
Offer is from a Trading Firm which is still a small-mid sized company.
I see this as a lowball offer, whilst UAE being tax-free actually gets one saved similar numbers over time, still skeptical this is not a legit pay range. Thoughts?
