Hello, I have around 1+ year of experience and graduated from Tier-1 colege. Previously worked at FAANG and had base around 19L
Wanted to ask is it safe to join Fi.Money(Epifi). It has been founded in 2019 only and it's an early age startup. If Yes, Can someone tell what are the pros (unique benefits) that this company has? And how is the work quality? I've read that there is very poor work life balance at Fi
Also I have another offer from ServiceNow of an IC2
Base 21L , Bonus-2L, Stocks - $35K(for 4 year and quaterly vesting) so around 30 L per year CTC
So what compensation should I ask/expect from Fi. They mostly asked LC Hard questions. So I expect they would also give better compensation. I don't have much inclination towards ServiceNow
Thank you
