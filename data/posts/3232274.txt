Other details:
After the recent layoffs that have been happening in 2023, they have started laying off their existing employees that were on the higher side of the compensation spectrum and hiring their replacements at half of what they were offering earlier taking advantage of the sudden increase of people in the talent pool in the industry and the desperation for jobs among candidates. Unfortunately, I was also affected as a result of this and let go around new year 2022-23 (after just 4 months).
The company is a great place to work for as long as you are willing to accept a nominal hike or get somewhat lowballed. If you manage to negotaite a "higher salary", you will always be on the risk of being let go as soon as they find a more "econimical" replacement for you.
The company is doing quite well and making good profits and is self sustained as well with a decent runway. Moreover, it hardly has 150 employees. So, it is very strange and sad to see the company taking such steps to save a few lakhs and tainting the entire Indian startup ecosystem in the process.
