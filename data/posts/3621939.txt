Hey guys
hope everything's fine.
I have recently cleared all the rounds for SDE 2 position at swiggy
Could you please advise me whether it's good idea to join swiggy on contract basis  where I'll be an employee of some other firm but will be working for swiggy. Given the current market scenario is it a good idea?
Also can you let me know if its a good idea then what could be the expected salary for 5+ yoe.
Looking forward to your response.
Update
Just a quick update guys. These guys can't even provide 30 LPA for 5+ YOE person and that's not even 20% raise from the current salary. And at the begining they were saying that they will match whatever the expected numbers were. So it was complete waste of time.
