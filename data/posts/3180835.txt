I am a graduate of IIT BHU. I have around 1.5 years of experience in Frontend Development. I was recently laid off, been 4 weeks but I am only getting calls from very small start-ups, like 5-10 people. Havent even heard from a single Mid-sized/Large companies yet. I apply through LinkedIn and have profile on Naukri.
The reason I mentioned IIT beacause, even after having the tag of Tier-1 college, I am not getting calls, I have a decent good enough resume. Just saw a post of a guy from a random college working in a service based company got calls from decent companies. Kudos to the guy for hard work and all those but what are you people doing to get calls?
Any suggestions?
