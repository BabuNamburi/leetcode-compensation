Google's initial offer was around $161000/year over four years.
Negotiated and asked them to increase it. The HR presented a number. I did my research on offers given to people with the same experience and level, at the location. Google NC office is very new and not many offers made for this location. I told HR that the offer is low, she suggested that she could work on a number that is 5k-10K around the number, I gave her 122K as a base to work with, she came back to me with 125K, so it all worked out.
