Well I was the part of the lay - off from my previous firm. I felt, because the market was so unpredictable it was good to join as soon as possible. I got offer from Toshiba India. I was expecting fixed as 25 Lakhs, but was asked for negotiation in HR round. My previous eaning was 18.5 lakh as fixed and approximately 2-3 lakhs bonus in a year ~10% hike, plus stock of 1-2 lakh in a year.
I had no intention to negotiate but was not in the condition for taking risk, so I agreed on 22 lakhs as fixed. But it was quite disspointing seeing they offered me 22 lakhs as total CTC where 20.3 is fixed rest is bonus also because it is a Japanese company it would not be giving any stock, and the joining is immediate (next day).
I accepted the offer letter feeling graditute, something is better than nothing
