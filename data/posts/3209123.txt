Other details:
I had expectation of 25LPA fixed (communicated before the process started)
The tech interview process was easy and smooth (1 DS/Algo, 1 System Design, 1 HM, 1 HR(worst part) )
HR discussion happened over phone call(was told about matching other offers(~30LPA CTC))
offer letter received with 22.5base and I replied for negotitation to atleast 25
=> highly unprofessional HR, I doubt the company culture, anyone interviewing or holding offers please be informed
=> was told that the position is for 3+ YOE only and you being less than that should be at our mercy
=> also that there would be a parity issue among the already employed SDE-2s in the org with similar exp and TC of 15LPA
