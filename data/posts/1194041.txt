Cleared all rounds of interview but the offer was reverted when the HR came to know that I was a 2022 grauduate. They were looking for 2020 graduated students at the least. I had already told the interviews my graduation year, they did not have a problem with that. After clearing all the rounds, they suddenly had a problem with my graduation year.
