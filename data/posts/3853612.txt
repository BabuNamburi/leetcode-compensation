Could you please suggest which company should i prefer.
Compensation wise Oci is better but i am not sure if they would consider me for promotion in next cycle.
I Doubt that if i choose Oci, then i will be working as MTS only for total 4 years of my career.
I am looking opportunity which would give me opportunity so that i can apply for sde2 positions in Product based companies like (Uber, Confluent, Amazon etc.)
This will be my third company , please consider that as well.
I am looking for company where i could make some impact and improve my resume.
Thanks
