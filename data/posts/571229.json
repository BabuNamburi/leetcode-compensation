Should not pose a problem for anybody reading this post :)\nOnline interview:\n5 minutes to present yourself and them to present themselves.\n40 minutes to solve a coding excercise. I had to solve Number of Islands. Did so communicating every thought that crossed my mind. There was not a single second of silence during the whole interview. I felt this was my strongest point - communication. I arrived at an optimal solution (doing BFS around each 1 with the aid of a queue), but not before discussing some slower/less optimal solutions, like a brute-force approach.\n15 minutes to answer Leadership Principles-related questions. I had already thought a real-life example of myself acting according to each of the principles. I recommend doing the same, as you might go blank when asked during the interview!"}
