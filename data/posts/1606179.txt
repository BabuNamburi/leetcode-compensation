Rejected the offer since it was not even higher than my current TC but my main concern was downlevel.
I would suggest anyone who gets downleveled, to never accept the offer. Getting downleveled is just Google's way of politely saying that you are rejected. And so, you should just treat it as a rejection (unless you desperately want to work at Google because of pReStigE).
Edit 1:
The reason for downlevel was poor performance in one of the rounds. Feedback for other rounds was perfect.
Current TC: INR 36L
