I always got exceptional rewards in Microsoft. I will mostly be updated to level 62 in March next year. Have a good reputation in the team as well. But why I'm leaving MS, my onhire stocks will be exhausted in next 6 month. There is no gaurantee that I will be getting refersher or not (mostly people don't get this AFAIK). Also, I have worked in same team for all 3+ years, so need a change, better to do with more salary than changing team withing MS. I can always come back to MS probably after 2 year with much higher salary than if I stay in MS.
PS: Got a lot of push from M1 and M2 to stay, they were okay to talk with HR for compensation and change of team. But mark my words it's never a good idea to stay after you resign.
Will add interview experience in sometime.
