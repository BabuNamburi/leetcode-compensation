I recently got his information about salary breakdown for Amazon India PPO offer from 1st gen IITs
I can confirm this is of Amazon, the original image is much longer and states the name of company many times as well.
Can anyone else confirm such large salaries for freshers? If yes, will this be offered to 2nd gen IITs, NITs and other institutions as well or is this something reserved for top IITs?
This is an extremely huge hike as compared to previous offers, so I just wanted to confirm the validity of this image and whether if this is the new salary that Amazon will provide from now on to freshers?
UPDATE : So the salary is real, it is confirmed from IIT Guwahati PPO. However, I have yet to confirm from other clgs and also, the oncampus offer seems less, so how is the salary being decided? I have no idea. Will be happy if anyone reading this could provide more info, if they have any! :)
