Good company culture along with good work life balance is my priority. I do not see myself spending 3+ yrs in any of these orgs and may switch for TC bump. So I am confused between joining fintech or product based company. Myntra would have been an easy choice but TC difference is quite huge in other offers. TC at myntra is non-negotiable and they are aware of my other offers.
I am requesting the community to please help me evaluate the pros and cons of these companies with respect to factors mentioned above and help me in making the right choice.
