Why Software Engineer?
Maersk has different means for designations. They offer Senior Software Engineer roles for people with over 11-13 years of experience on average. And Lead Engineers are managers (There are no Engineering Manager role) with over 15+ years of experience.
I acknowledge that the compensation is little bit below par for my experience and I know that Maersk may not be a "true" internet company, however I accepted the offer. Because this is a breakthrough in my career as I wanted to make a shift from service based companies.
Things in pipeline
I'm also giving interviews in other companies such as Vimeo. Three rounds went well so far for Vimeo and I'm waiting for my result to proceed to round 4. I have applied for Lead Engineer posts in few more companies as well.
I would like to know your opinion about Maersk. Also, is Vimeo a good place to work if I made it through?
