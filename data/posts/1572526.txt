Education: B. Tech. CSE from a tier 4 university
Experience: 3 month internship at a startup
Company: Sense
Location: Bangalore (WFO mandatory)
Total comp: 50,000 INR per month
This is a 6 month internship offer but the company is willing to convert me into full-time earlier (2-3 months in) if the performance is satisfactory.
Can anyone drop any details about Sense's work culture, TC for full-time SDE-1 roles, details about benefits and the office? They're hiring aggressively from what I see on LinkedIn.
I'll appreciate any input. I've received competing offers from other companies as well. Also, feel free to comment any questions, I'll be sure to answer them.
