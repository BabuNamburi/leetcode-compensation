I have an offer from Morgan Stanley [22+3 + 1.5 (joining bonus) ]
Link - https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/1332719/morgan-stanley-manager-sde2/1010398
I have cleared rounds for Zscaler, Goldman Sachs and Snapdeal and tomorrow I have my HR discussions.
How much should I ask the HR? Any advice would be really appreciated as I had bad experience negotiation during my first switch.
My current CTC is (11+1.5) with 4.5 years of experience.
