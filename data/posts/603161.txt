For fresh grad, any related Internship/coop experience?
The easiest way to crack a job offer starts with an internship. I got my internship in Tekizma for 6 months during my 8th semester and got a chance to work in a live project. My interest lied in Stats, Maths and application of those and hence I got a chance to switch to Business Analyst Position. As my coding experience was sharpened during my internship and my love for stats helped me the job as a Business Analyst in JK Lakshmi Cement.
For experienced engineer, what's your current and past experience?
I work in JK Lakshmi Cement as a Business Analys. Here I work on algorithms mostly concerned to increase the contribution of the company. recently I have worked on Market Value Prediction with the accuracy of 66%, Dealer Churn, Customer Retention.
