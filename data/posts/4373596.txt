Hey, folks. Recently, there was a hiring drive for Walmart for IN3/IN4 roles.
I cleared all the interview rounds and received an offer from them yesterday.
Education: B.Tech in Computer Science from a Tier-3 college
Years of Experience: 3.5
Prior Experience: Currently in an early phase startup and previously in Amazon
Company: Walmart
Title/Level: IN3 - Software Engineer III
Location: Bangalore, KA
Salary (Base): 27L
Joining Bonus: 1L
RSUs: 25% of Base, vested over 3 years
Bonus: 20% of Base, every year
Total comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): ~35L (excluding JB)
Benefits: Standard walmart benefits
Other details: Offer is non-negotiable from Walmart's end (expected)
Current TC: 24L (Base) + 2.7L (Bonus)
It's a lowball offer, right? What do you folks think?
I don't have any other offers right now, so, should I accept it or reject it?
