Other details:
This 18.15 includes bonus of 1.4 lack which will be paid on quartely basis or yearly basis.They mentioned that it will be defenetely 100% paid(but i am not sure from my end) .I have antoher offer from MTX group with 18 fixed and 50k bonus but it is for salesforce development. I am counsfued which one to choose.
Should I go and join Mcafee as it has little brand value compare to MTX.I have negotiated with Mcafee but they are not ready to increase compensation and also not even joining bonus.
Note: I am java developer and Mcafee position is for same,but MTX is recruting for salesforce.
Any suggestions would be helpful
