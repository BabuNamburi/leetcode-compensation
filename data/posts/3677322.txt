cleared the interview for walmart SSE (IN4) and expecting an offer soon.
In current market i am seeing every company is low balling with candidates. Is this the same case with Walmart?
Please provide tips for negotiation as HR didnot even ask my expectation and said they will get back with some number directly.
Any help would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance :)
