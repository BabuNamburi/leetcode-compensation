Hello Fellow Leetcoders,
Recently got offer from Microsoft IDC and need your help in reviewing the same and room for negotiation:
Compensation Details:
Education: B.Tech In CSE from Top NIT
Years of Experience: 9+
Prior Experience:
Current Company: Adobe, Bangalore
Title: Computer Scientist 2
Date of the Offer: September 2021
Company: Microsoft
Title/Level: Senior Software Engineer / L64

Base Salary: 46L

This is the initial offer and they didn't offer any significant hike over current TC, just matched my current TC.
Need your inputs on how much can I negotiate on base and stocks as offer in it's current form isn't acceptable as it doesn't add much value in compensation.
