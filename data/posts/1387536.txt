Hi Everyone,
I have got an offer from company A and accepted the offer. But In the notice period time I decided to try my luck and fortunately got an offer from another company B givining 7LPA (current offer + 7LPA) more salary on the current offer.
Now I wants to take decision weather I should go with company A as I gave my word for joining or should go with B as they offering more salary.
In case if I go with company B than how should I decline the offer of company A (in A good ethical way as they shown trust in me).
Please suggest me with good reason so that I can take decision.
