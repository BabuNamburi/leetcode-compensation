Education: B.Tech from Tier 1 (2024 Grad)
Experience: Fresher (Previously Interned at a MNC for 2 months)
Holding 2 offers from:
Cisco: 28.89 LPA CTC (Software Engineer, Off campus)
Fixed+PF+ Gratutity : 17 lakhs
Joining Bonus : 6.5 lakhs (Over 2 years)
TC for first year ~ 25 LPA (Fixed+PF+JB+ Stocks(only for first year))
Deutsche Bank: 19.63 LPA CTC (Graduate Analyst)
Fixed Pay+ PF+Gratutity : 16
Joining Bonus : 3 LPA (All in 1st yr)

Which offer should I choose, my priorities as of now are- Learning>Comp>WLB.
Is it worth joining as a sde in a bank? (I should get an off campus wells fargo offer as well with a TC almost similar to DBOI and ctc of 24lpa)
Where are the learning oppurtunities better for a fresher among these companies?
