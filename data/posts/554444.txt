Other details: This was clearly a lowball offer right from the start, both in terms of salary and level. I tried to negotiate level by bumping to 61/62 as my current level is equivalent to L61/62, but based on the resitance I received I rejected their offer. Made no sense to negotatiate salary as I figured even after negotiation they won't be able to match the equivalent of my current salary.
