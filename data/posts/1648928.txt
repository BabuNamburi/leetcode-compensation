Salary: 14LPA(base)
YOE: 5 months fulltime + 6 months internship
No stocks and bonus
I think they are lowballing me, as engineers there get offered around more than 16LPA(base)
Update: they are saying we can only do 10+2
What should I do?
Should I interview at more companies and drop this offer?
Location is wfh or Delhi(NCR)
