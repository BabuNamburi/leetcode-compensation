Other details: I felt I was being highly underpaid at my current org so decided to switch, this feels kind of like a lowball too but I accepted it hoping to make full utilization of the 2 month notice to look for better. I've been advised against Oracle because of it's low/none appraisal and poor work culture. What are your thoughts?
