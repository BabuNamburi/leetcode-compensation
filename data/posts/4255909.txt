I'm looking for feedback on my recent job offer. I couldn't negotiate much due to a lack of competing offers, and during appraisal cycle my current company gave me a 30% raise and has been recognitioned several times for my contributions.
The interviewer is behaving as if she has done me a significant favor, and I should be mindful of the debt I owe her.
Do you think this offer is too low? Your input is appreciated.
Any comments on the company work culture and growth would be benificial for me.
Thanks for you help :)
