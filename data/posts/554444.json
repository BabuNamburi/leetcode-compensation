{"text": "Education: MS in CS\nYears of Experience: 3.5 in US (post MS)\nPrior Experience: Backend Software Engineer\nDate of the Offer: March 2020\nCompany: Microsoft\nTitle/Level: Software Development Engineer L60\nLocation: Redmond, WA\nSalary: $119,000\nSigning Bonus: $15,000\nRelocation: ~$10,000\nStock bonus: $45,000 vested over 4 years\nAnnual Bonus: Performance based. Range is 0 - 20%. For those who meet expectations, it's 10% + $9000 stock vested over 5 years\nBenefits: Standard PTO and other benefits\nOther details: This was clearly a lowball offer right from the start, both in terms of salary and level. I tried to negotiate level by bumping to 61/62 as my current level is equivalent to L61/62, but based on the resitance I received I rejected their offer. Made no sense to negotatiate salary as I figured even after negotiation they won't be able to match the equivalent of my current salary."}
