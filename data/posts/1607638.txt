I joined a D2C startup recently as SDE-3 two weeks back. Before joining I gave interview at Microsoft but they come up with an offer after I joined this startup. So yesterday I came up with this offer please suggest is it a good idea to switch to Microsoft now ?
Compensation in current D2C startup

Variable - 2,00,000
Joining Bonus - 2,00,000 with 2 year clawback
Role and Work wise it is good in current company. I was given a lead SDE-3 position. Work is good. I am responsible for building some critical features.
I am not sure about the work at microsoft. They said it is into Microsoft 365 team, but not sure about the work.
Please suggest. Thanks in advance!
