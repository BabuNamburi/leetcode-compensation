I am expecting offer of Staff role from ZS at Bangalore office. Dev role in cloud security.
Wanted to know how much I can expect.
Current Company: McAfee
Current TC: 39LPA (35 Fixed + 4 Bonus)
YOE: 10+
EDIT:-
Also want to know if offered RSU's are part of total compensation or would be considered separately?? Asking this because while asking for % hike I asked for a specific amount only and didn't consider this in the calculation, now if it would be considered in TC then my take home hiked salary would be peanuts only :'(
Any reply on this is highly appreciable. Thanks.
