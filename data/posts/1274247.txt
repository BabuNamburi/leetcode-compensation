I did not negotiate as I had a better offer from another company. Upon declining, the recruiter also added 2L sign-on bonus.
So, if you're going for Expedia, make sure you negotiate well. The recruiter will always tell you that it is the best they can do, but trust me, there is room for a lot more if you have competitive offers in hand. Good luck!
