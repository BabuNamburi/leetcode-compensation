Rounds and interview
Round 1: Online test with 1 graph based question. Can be categorized as LC medium. Had 30 MCQs with aptitude, code output, networking, etc. Total time: 1hr
Round 2: Technical round. Was asked questions on DBS concepts, language specific questions on Java and Python, and a LC easy DSA question.
Round 2: Managerial round: General behavorial questions. Asked about college projects, and ended with 2 puzzles which were tricky. Got 1 and didn't get the other. Just be open and think out your logic.
Round 3: HR round. Basic questions like 'why do you want to join Cisco?' A couple more general questions about myself. Was the easiest round by far.
Result: Selected
Kinda bummed that they stopped giving stocks from our batch. 14.5L vested over 4 years. 2019 CTC for our seniors was 28.9L, but it is a great company with an amazing environment with ample learning opportunities. Overall a great catch.
All the best for you guys!
