YOE: 3
Wayfair:
Comp: ~37lpa all fixed. Zero benefits(no cab, free meals etc) apart from this.
Supply chain team - modernising the tech stack
Just starting up in bangalore (so, many policies are not yet set)
WLB for now seems to be good from what I hear; Not sure how it would pan out later
Loc: Bang
Title: L2
Salesforce (expected):
Comp: ~45 CTC with ~32 fixed plus other standard salesforce benefits
Industries cloud lifesciences team under healthcare
Monolith, legacy tech stack,
Loc: Bang/Hyd
Title: MTS
Can anyone from Salesforce comment on how this particular team is?
And, which company would be a better option for now and also keeping future career options in mind?
I feel Wayfair could be a better option work wise, but with Salesforce, comp is much higher and is also a better brand on resume I guess. Hence, in a dilemma.
