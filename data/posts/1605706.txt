Education: B.Tech (Tier 3)
Years of Experience: 11 months
I started my career in a startup as a full stack engineer with a salary of 6LPA (all fixed).
Looking at my performance in my current organisation, within 10 months I've received two hikes and I've reached to 9.6LPA (all fixed).
I've the final salary discussion round with another company, how much should I quote them? ( this new company has raised around $35M till now in a really short span of time)
It would be really helpful if someone can guide me, since I'm a newcomer.
