I recently got a call from my recruiter that I have cleared all rounds for FB E5 position. They want me to select location before they can proceed.
Menlo Park 2) Seattle 3) New York.
I am completely unknown about anything of these locations. So Can someone guide me which I should choose. Some of the parameters can be cost of living, other growth opportunities etc. I don't. have kids now.
What numbers should I ask as a compensation ?
