After accepting this offer, I received another offer from a fintech firm for ~56 LPA but my priority right now is WFH job. I'll be joining paytm for their WFH policy, but, should I use the new offer to negotiate or its risky to do it now as I'm afraid they might rescind and thats the only WFH offer I have
Any suggestion on negotiation would be helpful
