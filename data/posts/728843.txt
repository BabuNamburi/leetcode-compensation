The initial offer was for $140000 base but I wanted an increase in the signing bonus as I thought it was not possible to get a raise in the base. Recruiter came back that it was not possible to increase the signing bonus anymore but was willing to up the base to $145000. I am happy to see the base increased as that was what I wanted :)
