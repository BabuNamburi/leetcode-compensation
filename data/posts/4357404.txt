I have received offers from Coinbase, Atlassian, and Amazon, among a few other startups. The offer from Coinbase surpasses the others significantly, but I have doubts regarding the work-life balance and job security, given the crypto domain's uncertainties. Atlassian seems like a suitable option, but I am unsure if it justifies the compensation difference.
Field Value
Education B.Tech CSE, Tier 2 college
YoE 5 years
Current Company One of FAAMNG, except Amazon duh!
Current Compensation 48.5 L
Reason for switch Cliff and peanut hikes in last 2 years
Date of Offers Nov 2023
Coinbase Offer* 95 L (60L + 6L + 29L)
Atlassian Offer** 78 L (44L + 4.4L + 30L)
Amazon Offer*** 68 L (44L + 22L + 2L)
* Coinbase grants RSUs for one year, quarterly vesting, next year RSUs based on performance which is a bummer
** Atlassian has promised 4 years worth RSUs, yearly vesting
*** 22L is first year joining bonus plus typical Amazon vesting period
Factors to consider:
Both Coinbase and Amazon have a 10% enforced PIP quota and poor work-life balance. Additionally, Coinbase has been silently laying off employees across all domains, a significant reason leaning me towards Atlassian.
Coinbase offers better learning opportunities than Amazon and Atlassian.
The Coinbase stock has seen a significant increase in the last few months. Consequently, I may receive grants at a high valuation, potentially resulting in a loss.
While Coinbase and Atlassian offer full remote work, Amazon requires relocation to Bangalore. This is not a decisive factor for me as I am already based in Bangalore.
Here's my few questions:
Can anyone provide insights into Coinbase's actual work-life balance?
Is the compensation offered by Coinbase justified, considering the risks associated with the volatile crypto industry, ongoing layoffs, and potential government regulations?
PS: I'll add my interview experiences, other offers, and hell lot of rejections in separate posts.
