Currently working at FORTUNE 40 E-Commerce.
Current CTC - approx 24LPA
Offer from PayPal:
1st LOI: 29 base, 10% var, 30k USD stocks.
2nd LOI: 29 base, 10% var, 40k USD stocks.
Despite asking for revision in base and providing JB multiple times, I was denied.
Its Full remote Job.
I think I am being lowballed here. Suggesstion pls.
No other offers, except from am LOI from OLA, that too of pretty much the same base, but with JB.
Not even thinking to join OLA, due to bad work culture.
Please can anyone suggest-
SDE3 at 29 base, is it being lowballed ?
Work culture at PP.
I want to consider PayPal coz of remote work opportunity.
Please help.
**My Preference: **Work Culture + WLB >> CTC =~ WFH
