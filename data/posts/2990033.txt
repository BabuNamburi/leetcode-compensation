Hi Leetcode squad. I have been offered the following :
Current offers :
(1)
Position : Staff Software Engineer
Company: Agoda (Booking.com Holding company)
Location: Bangkok, Thailand
Compensation:

bonus = 2-3 months salary => 360,000 - 540,000 BHT per year (8.7 - 13 LPA)
stocks => $25,000 for 3 years => $8300 per year or 285,000 BHT per year(6.8 LPA)
Total compensation => 2,805,000 - 2,985,000 BHT per year(2,160,000 + 360,000 / 540,000 + 285,000) => 67 - 72 LPA (INR) per year

(2)
Position: Senior Software Engineer
Company: Adyen

total compensation => 63 LPA (INR) (50 + 10 + 3)
taxes => 30% flat on salary (India)
I was initially being considered for Staff Engineer role at Adyen, but then they found a candidate with 10+ years of experience and said that they would consider me for Senior Software Engineer and then promote in 1-2 years to Staff Engineer role based on performance.

Future aspirations and what I am looking for in my next job:
I have currently been working in a startup environment, WLB has been poor so far. So I am looking for a company with :
decent WLB
good compensation
career-growth
internal transfer (if possible) to other centers / locations
good brand name
(lol, aren't we all looking for this :D)
Both companies are good in above criteria, but I am not sure about these and would love the community's view on these :
comparison of the salary and expenses in Mumbai (India) vs Bangkok (Thailand)
possibility of internal transfer to other geographical location. Adyen is present in - India, Singapore, and Amsterdam (my team) whereas Agoda is present in India, Amsterdam, London, Canada, to name a few locations. Not sure whether people were eventually able to take an internal transfer. I have an affinity to relocate to Europe (US is out of questions due to visa limitations) or / and try a FAANG / FAANGMULA company eventually (around 1.5 years time) with similar job role / position.
I would love to hear your views / thoughts :)
PS :
LPA = Lakhs per Annum / year (Indian rupees)
INR = Indian rupees
BHT = Thai Bhat
