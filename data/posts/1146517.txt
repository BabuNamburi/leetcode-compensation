DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY IS THIS POST BEING DOWNVOTED?
Obviously, I did not post this for getting upvotes. It is to help other people on leetcode. These posts have helped me a lot in knowing what the companies are currently offering and I could negotiate based on these kinds of posts on Leetcode. Downvoting it will not help anyone.
