Facebook, Amazon, and Google all made offers. My negotiation "strategy" was to be very open and honest with all recruiters, keeping them informed about what everyone else was saying.
Facebook's initial offer was about $295000/year.
Google made a counteroffer 5% higher than that.
Facebook had largely maxed out the E4 pay band and so were unable to fully match, but did bump up the base salary a bit.
