I just got an offer from Microsoft and I am in negotiation phase.
Current base is $78k and YOE ~7
Microsoft Offer: (Cloud and AI org) Azure Compute team
Position: SDE 2 (L61) asking for L62 and if so what should be the base?
Base : $140k
RSU : 80k
sign on: 35k
Location: Bellevue
Is this a good offer for ~7 YOE? Also given the scenario that Microsoft layoff are happening so is it a good idea to join Microsoft?
I am hoping to get one more offer soon but this is what I got so far so just wanted to negotiate better. Any feedback is appreciated.
Thanks
