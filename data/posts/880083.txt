Education: B Tech from Tier 1
Years of Experience: 5+
Date of the Offer: Oct 2020
Company: Amazon
Title: SDE 2
Location: Hyderabad
Base: Rs 32L
Joining Bonus: 14L for year 1, 9.5L for year 2
Stocks: 12 units for 4 years [5%, 15%, 40%, 40%]
Total comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): ~ Rs 46L for 1st year
Other details: They aren't open to negotiation
The stocks seem to be quite low. They are not willing to negotiate - I am not sure how to go about this.
I have a competing offer at 45L at a startup (with a comparatively higher base), hence they seem to be just matching it and not going beyond that.
Can you guys suggest what I could do?
