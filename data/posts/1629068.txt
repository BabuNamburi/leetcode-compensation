I asked for 55K, they started with 43K and came to 50K. We both agreed verbally for 50K as base. I then asked HM on that same call to give a sign on bonus, they said no. I asked at least give me 1 way economy flight ticket, they said no and rudely said "I am speaking from a position of power. I have 5 candidates pending, if you say no. If you don't like it, walk away". I was shocked with this rudeness and got numbed. I mean who says things like I have 5 candidates and all. But I anyway said I accept this.
Then HM closed the call and recruiter calls back after 5 mins and says suddenly, "this req is now no longer open and is closed by HR, so you are not selected", and I got a rejection letter.
Stay away from this company. Anyway the salary they offered is s^^t for my YOE. Anyway I dodged a bullet here, cannot imagine working with that HM. And this was a terrible lowball, given the current market.
