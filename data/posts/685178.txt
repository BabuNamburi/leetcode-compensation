Interview Details:
Phone Screen Round 1: One simple coding question on finding the kth largest element in an array. DL breadth covering when to use wide vs deep networks; whether GD/SGD always decreases loss; one LP question
Phone Screen Round 2: ML Depth, mostly focusing on my PhD research and publications. We discussed a particular paper of mine in great depth. It was more of an open ended discussion than the interviewer asking me questions.

Round 1: One hour research talk; got asked a couple of questions may be throughout
Round 2: Bar Raiser: LPs and ML Applied problem solving pertaining to Recommendation Systems and Error constrained classification
Round 3: ML Breadth, Mostly related to properties of loss functions; optimization in general; robustness of DL algorithms; 2 LP questions

Round 5: Hiring Manager round. 25 mins of LPs followed by a deep dive of one of my previous internship projects.
Round 6: ML Depth, Was very much like my phone screen round 2. The interviewer particularly discussed one of my recent papers in great depth. Questions ranged from from clarification questions to what ifs?
