Other offers: I had offers from Microsoft, Oracle, Magic Leaps (AR start up) but none could compete against this offer.
I heard this is about the median or slightly low for an E4 position at Facebook. I had another offer from Microsoft but it was not competable at all. or maybe because stock prices dropped a lot due to the pandemic.
