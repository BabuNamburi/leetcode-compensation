Hi Guys,
Received an offer from hellofresh berlin [Need to relocate there].
Overall it is 93K Euros. 90K + 10K [RSUs vesting over 3 years] [10K will be given per year]
It's less-than what I earn with SDE-2 Role. But I don't like my current org [Please don't ask anything about it]. So need to move out ASAP. Also, I'd like to explore now.
Wanted to get some opinions [cost of living and work env] from anyone who work there.
Thanks in advance, yeah.
