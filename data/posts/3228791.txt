Hello everyone,
College: Tier3
Current Work Exp: 8.6 YOE
Current Organization: Product Based
Current Position: SSE
Current Compensation: 27(base)+2.5(variable bonus) Total CTC: 29.5LPA
Please suggest, what compensation range I can ask from another product based company for a lead software engineer position.
I have gone through multiple discussions but still wanted to hear from the people who know better about the market currently.
