I told the HR my expectations of 30L+ Fixed and gave 4 rounds of interviews.
1 day after salary discussion round, HR offered me 29L Fixed + 2L Bonus + 1L Variable on which i negotiated to increase the fixed amount even more but it could not happen, so we both agreed on this amount.
When i got the offer letter next day, in that the CTC was mentioned as 24L Fixed + 1L Variable. HR told me to forget all our previous discussions and this is the maximum they can offer. Will a person who already has 23L fixed take up their offer of 24L?
Please refrain from giving interviews of such companies who give false hopes and waste candidate's time.
