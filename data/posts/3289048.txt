Hi Guys,
Total Exp : 3+
Current Role: Data Engineer
Current company : A product based MNC
Any review about the company 'Internshala' or Tiger Analytics. How is it to work for them?
Compensation, WLB, perks etc?
Both offering same role , same level, same pay out.
Role : Senior Data Engineer
Level : L2
Pay : Around 18 LPA (HR discussion yet to happen)
Note: Internshala - product based mid range startup. They are building data engineering team from scratch.
Tiger analytics - service based mid range startup , they have multiple ongoing good data engineering projects.
What would be your suggestion in such scenario? Please guide.
