Was thinking long and hard about this and couldnt come up with a counterexample, so posting this here.
Indian Startups are NOT doing anything INNOVATIVE. It the same thing that most of them are doing just packaging them in different containers. Lets take the example of some of the biggest startups in India Swiggy, Zomato, BigBasket, Flipkart, Myntra etc(i know some are bigger than startups and some have been acquired), they all are doing the same thing. Some of them are selling clothes, some grocery, some appliances, some food. Each year a new startup comes that promises to deliver grocery in 5 mins less than the competitor. IMO all these startups are bound to fail at some point. Lets take the case study of Swiggy, Zomato. They both are eating from the same pie and the pie aint getting any larger. Its not like you will start consuming breakfast twice because of these companies. so as more companies start adding to this pie, the profit of Swiggy, Zomato will decrease(its bound to happen). What can be done? Open their business in new cities? Oh but hardly the restarurant infrastructure is there in smaller cities. So they need to diversify their business at some point to selling something other than food.
Most of the engineers working in these companies are also doing the same thing, maintaining Kafka queues, wriitng springboot to create a microservice that fetches some things from some queue and process it, or look at the data spit out of these services etc. The only new thing that they have to encounter is during these Big Billion Sales, where need to do the usual things at scale. But other than that what are they learning?
Please post your opinions. Would really love to hear everyones thoughts on this. Hope I am wrong.
