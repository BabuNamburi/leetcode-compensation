Hi I got a offer from JPMC :
Total Exp : 6.5 yrs
Current Company : Goldman Sachs
Profile : Java Backend
Current Comp -35 lpa(30 +5 )
Offer from JPMC:
Fixed - 40 lpa
bonus -(8 to 12 percent) around 4.5 max
other JPMC benefits like free transport ,food etc
My manager at GS is mentioning he can match the offer but only at year end and provide the difference as the year end bonus ,what should i do take the JP offer or stay with GS
The work and worklife balance is GS is really bad ,should i even go with the verbal commitment of my manager or he can provide the same in mail.
Help Me understand if it is Lowballed.
