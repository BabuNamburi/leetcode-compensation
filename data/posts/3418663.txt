Hi, I recently got a call from one of the unicorns of india, , they asked me about my expected salary. Based on my research from different platforms, I provided them with a figure of X as my expected CTC (comprising base salary and separate variables). However, later I discovered from various posts that they were offering up to 2X of what I had mentioned. I am now wondering if I can negotiate on this offer. I would appreciate your suggestions on how to proceed.
