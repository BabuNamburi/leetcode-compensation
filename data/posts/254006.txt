Outcome: Declined offer. After my successful interviews, I was told I'd be getting an offer, which I was intending to accept, but the company took long, long time (a month & a half) to actually get it to me. By the time they did, I had also received another offer, for slightly better compensation and doing more interesting work, which I accepted instead.
