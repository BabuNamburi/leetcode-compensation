Other details: Getting this offer was a rollercoaster. I applied in September, finished OAs in mid-October, and had final round 30-min interview end of October. They then sent me an email saying they wanted me but didn't have enough open spots at the time. So I got stuck on a waitlist with no idea when or if I would ever get an offer. It finally came today. RIP amazon waitlist.
