My friend got offer from Wipr* in September 2021 of package 3.5 Lpa during my final year. Then got assurance of increment in package from 3.5 to 6.5lpa if he complete a training of 4-5 months before onboarding. After completing the training, he was told to wait for onboarding. Even in the training period, he got 0 money as a stipend. His training started in May 2022 and ended in Aug-Sept 2022 and from September 2022, he was waiting for his onboarding..Few days back he is informed that sorry they can't onboard him now..
