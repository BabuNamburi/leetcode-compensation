Other details: The recuiter gave me two options: 1) I could take a Sunnyvale offer but I would have to move to Sunnyvale before my start date, even though offices are closed. 2) I could take an offer based on my current location (North Carolina) and postpone my move until offices re-open. At that time, I will request an internal transfer and my comp may or may not be adjusted. I decided to take option number 2 in order to take my time with the move and save money on rent for a little while. The initial offer for NC was $165,000 and I negotiated to $180,000
