Questions :
How is it to work in a team where all of your peers are based out of US? Does the collaboration / communication within the team takes a hit? Does it impact learnings?
Can someone provide some insights into WLB of harness. I have got mixed reviews over the internet and looking for some clarity.
I'm at a stage in my career where I want to work in slightly senior positions where I can get oppotunities to work on system designing / architecture and develop some leadership skills.
Please help me choose which one would be a great choice and also let me know if any suggestions/feedbacks?
