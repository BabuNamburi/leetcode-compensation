Hi Everyone, i hope you're doin well
jumping directly into the topic, i ggot an offer for a junior engineer role in london and got an annual salary of 55k pounds with also some stack options and relocation bonus, question is for london based people do you think 55k per year for a single person will be sufficient in london?
Thanks ALL!!!
