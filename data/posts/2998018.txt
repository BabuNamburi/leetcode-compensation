My question is
Which offer is better? I'm more inclined towards Axis Mutual Fund as SADA Title is Support that too Rotational Shift but i'm not sure about Axis Mutual Fund Company enviornment.
Can I get Development Role as SADA as I'm looking for Remote Job and is there scope of negotiation?
Need to know AXIS Mutual Fund:
How is Work, culture, WLB, growth and development, flexibility etc.?
Also, What is Position Allowance any idea? I was told it's a way to save Tax by investing in company benefits like Meal voucher and Company scheme/plan investement.
Also Wanted to ask if I don't opt for any plan/scheme for tax benefit will I be eligible to claim complete amount without any clauses? Or there are some plan which employee has to opt for mandetory?
