Right now I'm going through Netskope interview process for Senior Staff. I would like to know what would be the salary range for Senior staff.
Also one more thing I'm currently a Principal Engineer (promoted from Senior Staff) at current company. Would it be fine if I move to Netskope as Senior Staff.
These things will help me in negotiations.
Thanks in Advance.
