The recruiter reached out to me through a Google Form.
2 Interviews were scheduled for my Role.
I aced all of them and things were going quite good.
The Interviewers were quite impressed by my previous experiences and we had a good conversation.
Later, the Recruiter informed me that the team gave a positive feedback but due to some internal rearrangements, my profile has been kept on hold for some time.
When I reached them out again after some time, they informed me that the role is closed and I have not got an offer ðŸ™‚.
Worst Experience! ðŸ˜”
