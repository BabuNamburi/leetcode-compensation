Can someone working/worked at Cognizant guide here if I will be mapped to correct role that I was interviewed for (Java Developer)? Or they will just assign me to random projects with different domain like Salesforce etc irrespective of my skillset?
I got positive reviews about work at Coditas and pretty much sure about the role that I will be getting. But I am not sure if I will get proper assignment post joining Cognizant..
