Work Culture:
9-5 (or whatever 8 hour slot around this time) work timings are followed religiously.
Focus on work during work timings, focus on life after work hours. Work hard, party hard basically.
Amazing and knowledgeable team and don't hesistate to answer even the most basic doubts.
Most of the time you're assigned a problem statement and you need to work on it with a team.
But if you're put in a team working on an actual product, then you'll be given a basic task. If you can complete that within a good (short) amount of time, you'll be provided with more interesting tasks.
