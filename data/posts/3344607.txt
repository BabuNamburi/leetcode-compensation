First round was MCQ's from CS core concepts(DS, DBMS, OOPS, CN, OS) and quantitative aptitude on Pravesh.
Second round was like a design round, they expect SOLID principle's in your code.
Third round was technical round in my case there were two interviewers, they evenly focused on (DS, DBMS, OOPS, CN, OS) and projects.
Final round was general HR with question's like are you Ok with company like things.
