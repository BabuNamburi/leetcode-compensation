I've have received offers from both Amazon & OCI.
YoE - ~8
Previous Organization - Mid-size Company
OCI
Base - 37 + 1k Stocks + (4+4)L Joining Bonus + PF + Gratuity
TC - ~57LPA
Amazon
Base - 33 + 17 Stocks + (19+13)L Joining Bonus + PF + Gratuity.

I'm not too sure which company to join. Been hearing a lot of negative reviews recently about OCI.
Any feedback is appreciated.
