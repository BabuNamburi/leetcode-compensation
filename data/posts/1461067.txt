update :
Interview Experience :
HR told Each round was a elimination round.
Round 1 (DSA):
In this round two problem was asked it was straight from leetcode , but wording was bit changed :
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-taps-to-open-to-water-a-garden/description/
https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/
Round 2 (Low level Design):
This was a very interesting round , the interviwer present me with the maze like picture from the game, and asked to come up with a Low level design. I clarified few edge cases and created the required models , the interactions the user will have etc. not the complete working code was expected, but still the interviewer was looking on the design and the main functions you would be interacting with.
Round 3 (Low level Design):
This Round as well, were focusing more on the low level design, the interviwer came up with some werid problem which I don't remember and at the end asked clarfiying questions and drilled down to specifics.
Round 4 (with Director of Engineering):
This round was mix of all, we introduced he asked a couple question on DS solved them in my IDE and presented the same, it was Medium level LC questions, post that he asked a common design question like design a FB newsfeed, we ran through my design.
overall the experience with zynga games is good, they focus more on the low level design since you would be working more on the client side.
