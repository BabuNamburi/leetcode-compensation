Optum, UHG - Hyderabad
Profile:
B. Tech in ECE 9.20 CGPA from Tier 2 NIT
Projects and internships in applied ML
Got oncampus offer in Sept 2019, joined Optum in Aug 2020 after my graduation
CTC of 13.5 LPA (11 L fixed + 50k relocation + 2L RRP based on performance)
[Monthly inhand about 85 to 90k depending on PPF or any other investments]
Some info about the organization from my experience so far:
Usually the probation period is 6 months (may extend based on case-to-case basis) after which one is converted to full time.
For internally transfering to other positions within Optum, you need to be in the organization for atleast 18 months and meet threshold in your previous year's performance review.
Work hours are a bit odd for my team in particular (because of collab sessions with onsite team in the US), from 11am to 7.30/ 8 pm [have been WFH, so not sure if these are the normal office hours too]
Good benefits including 5 privilege leaves every quarter which can be encashed upon seperation. (Apart from these about 10 casual and 10 sick leaves too every year)
Usually the annual performance reviews are in January/ February, because most oncampus joiners would have been the organization for 4 to 5 months, one could expect anything from 2 to 10 percent raise in their salary.
