Hi Everyone,
I have been offered by three companies Walmart (Fin-Tech), Paytm (Paytm-Money) and Swiggy (Contract). Need your suggestion and views on these offers in terms of pay, work quality, WLB, culture and future career scope. Please do UPVOTE and COMMENT for better reach and discussion.
I am more inclined towards Walmart and Paytm (Not considering Swiggy because of contractual position offer). Recently got offer from Paytm and yet to negotiate with Walmart (Need advise with respect to this also, how to negotiate to Walmart with competing offer. Do Walmart act/negotiate on competing offer or not).
Which one would be good opportunity from your opinion and views with repect to Pay, Work, Culture and WLB? It would be very helpful for me to decide on that front (2 weeks to join). Thanks in advance.
