Which offer is best out of the following?
Paytm: SDE-1 at (Bengalore)
Chargebee: Software Engineer(permanent WFH)
Arcesium: Contract based role for some reason.(Bengalore)
Paypal: I appeared for SDE-2, yet to get the offer.(Bengalore)
My priorities will be: technoogies/skills>>work culture and wlb>>Brand value. Basically I feel this priority order is better at start of my career.
I had other offers from Siemens, Freshworks and 2 startups, but their pay is very low comparitively, either heard very negative stuff about them from their current employees. I have talked to current employees of these companies as well. Chargebee seems like a super employee centric company. At Paytm got mixed reviews, with positive ones claiming it to be really cool. Arcesium is good, but contract part is itching me and makes me uncomfortable, although it's offering highest base. Paypal would have been great, but the hiring process is extremely slow. Recruiter has assured me an offer, so let's see.
Please put forward your opinions on the above companies.
