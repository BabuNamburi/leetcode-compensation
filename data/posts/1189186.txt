I have another offer from Goldman Sachs (Bengaluru) as a Software Analyst.
Base : 25 LPA

HR says there will a variable bonus at the end of the year which can go up to 25% of the base pay depending on the performance i.e,, Bonus can range from (0 - 6L)
Which offer Should I accept? (Personally I like amazon coz of the FAANG tag and all but the base pay difference is 9L)
Which work experience would be more helpful if I wanna switch to Google/Microsoft/Apple etc. in future?
Any insights are welcome
