Hi Community, need an advice on the following offer. It's from a US based startup with a valuation > 1 billion $ and last raised Series C funding.
Years of experience - 6
Base salary - 56 lac (Including PF)
Joining bonus - 5 lac
Equity - 16000 stock options vested over 4 years.(Paper money currently but the startup is showing tremendous promise)
Current company - Oracle OCI(IC3)
Current base - 36 lac
Stock - 1200 units over 4 years (20 lac/ year based on current stock price)
The startup is offering current base + stock as base, is it a good deal for me to take at this point? Growth at OCI is not good. No hikes or refreshers provided recently.
