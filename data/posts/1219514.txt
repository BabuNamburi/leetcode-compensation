Years of Experience: 5, IT industry
Recetly opened a conversation with an Estonian Startup, Bolt. Need help with setting correct compensation expectations. Locally, among the offers i have, best is from Adobe (~50L).
Looking for any opinions about ballpark salary figures in Estonia, the best i can get, the components of compensation (signing bonus, performance bonus, equities) and such.
Also, some insights about the savings and taxes would be helpful too.
