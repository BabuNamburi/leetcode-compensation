I have 2 years of experience, been applying to companies for like 6 months now. I got like 4-5 calls after applying to almost 750+ companies. When will this terrible market situation improve? Is there any hope for us left?
Most people are telling like apply as much as possible, give as many interviews as you can, you'll definitely get selected, apply to 100-200, you'll get atleast 5, and bla bla bla.
My question is that, if we can't even get any calls from recruiters, how in the world will we be able to give "as many interviews as we can"?
Going forward, will this situation ever improve? Every job opening on Linkedin gets atleast 1000 applications within a few minutes. At this rate, what I feel is that even when the economic conditions get better, there will be so many of applicants out there who are applying that most people would never get any call.
And the people who are most affected are in the 0-3 years experience range. Most companies who have openings are hiring like Lead Engineers, Principal Engineers, Tech Leads etc with 6-8+ years of experience. I wonder, if all these companies are needing so much of people with 8 years experience, what will the lesser experienced people do? Whom are all these team leads leading if they don't even need any junior level people? After few years, how will companies be able to get experienced people if freshers from colleges and people with 1-2 years don't get hired now and get proper experience?
This is just a rant which will probably lead to nowhere. If you have read this far and have any suggestions/anything on your mind, feel free to comment and share your thoughts.
