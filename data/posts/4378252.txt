Hi Community,
Need one help here.
I have total 8+ years of experience and working as Tech Lead in FinTech company.
I recently interviewed with Salesforce for LMTS role. All rounds went really well. However recruiter is telling that I am not fit for LMTS and offering me SMTS role.
I have few questions to you all :-
What is minimum years of experience required for LMTS in Salesforce
What is the YOE range for SMTS
What is SMTS equivalant role in Amazon or Microsoft
Should I take this offer or not
If I accept the offer, will there be significant downgrade in my carrer (Tech Lead to SMTS)
Salary Range of SMTS
Requesting you all to help me with the answers if possible. Thank you so much in advance
