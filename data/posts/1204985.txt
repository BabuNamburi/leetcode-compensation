Company: Tekion
Title/Level: Associate Software Engineer(Backend)
Location: Hyderabad
Salary: 13 LPA
Relocation/Signing Bonus: 1 lakh
Stock bonus: 2000 units over four years
Total comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): 14 lpa + stocks
Other details: Competing offer from Druva (Backend Developer), details not shared yet. But expecting something very similar.
I'm mostly concerned about the kind of work that I would be doing in each of the firms, what would be my learning/career growth if I choose one over the other, and where would I get more opportunities to learn.
Thanks in advance for the help.
Note:- I had negotiated for 14.5-16 fixed at Druva so expecting around that.
