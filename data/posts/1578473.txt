Hello LC community, have received the following offers from Amazon and Uber respectively, kindly guide on which one to choose.
Monetary gain is secondary, I'm looking for a good WLB and decent work/engg culture. I wanted to say 'Yes' to Amazon, but have discovered rather recently that they have quite a bad WLB and their 'hire-to-fire' strat is also doing the rounds online.
Please do suggest what might be a good company to move to, settle down, and work at for the next 4 years, at the least.

The team at Amazon is going to be either of Prime Video, Amazon Advert, or Amazon Fashion (they pooled my profile), and at Uber, I think it's for an Internal Data Warehouse team.
