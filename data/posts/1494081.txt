How much does Facebook London pay new grads (base/RSU/sign-on)?
Is there room for negotiation? If yes, in which part (base or RSU or sign-on or all)?
I couldn't find too much data on levels.fyi for non-US roles.
Any insight would be highly appreciated! I am in the hiring process and wanted to get some info before talking to my recruiter.
