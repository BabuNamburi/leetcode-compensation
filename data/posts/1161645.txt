Having other offer from Amazon - https://leetcode.com/discuss/compensation/1125773/Amazon-or-SDE1-or-Bangalore
HR of Flipkart is not negotiating at all, despite Amazon's offer, and on top of that HR of Flipkart is suggesting to join Amazon as there's a significant difference in pay and they won't be able to match in any way!
I have seen them paying 21-22 as base if someone has counter offer, but don't know why they are showing so much of rigidness now!
