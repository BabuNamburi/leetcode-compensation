Can someone help me know what is the promo hike and yearlly average hike for L59->L60 and L60->L61. Also is L59->L60 in 1 year a very common thing?
I am currently an L59 and almost one year into microsoft and my manager said that he has recommended me for promotion. I wanted to know how much is the average promo hike in previous years.
