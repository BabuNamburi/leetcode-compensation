Hi Guys,
I have Walmart offer in pipeline for SDE 3 position.
College - Tier 3
YOE - 3 Years = 1 Year MNC + 2 Years (Fintech Startup Product Based), Current Company
My CTC - 8.2 (Fixed) +1 = 9.2 LPA

What should I ask for to Walmart as Fixed Compensation and Total Compensation?
How can I negotiate a better offer from Walmart?
