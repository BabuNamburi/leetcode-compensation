P.S. I have recently joined an organization as Technical Lead and in every component aspect this organization is paying better than viacom18. I tried to negotiate on numbers and designation but they told me that's the best they can do.
What you guys think am I being lowballed here. If not should I switch to this company considering I have joined the other one last month as these guys were really slow with interview process and took more than 2 months just to schedule 3-4 rounds.
