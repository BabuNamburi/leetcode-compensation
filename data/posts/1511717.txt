Hey guys, I've just received an offer from Amazon Luxembourg:
YoE: 5
Title/Level: Data Engineer. Level: Not specified
Location: Luxembourg
Salary: 77K EUR
Relocation/Sign-on Bonus: Relocation 7.5K USD + Sign-on bonus 13K EUR first year + 11K EUR second year
Stock bonus: 15 RSU (5% | 15% | 20% * 4 )
Bonus: Not specified
Benefits: standard Amazon Lux benefits (medical, lunch vouchers, etc.)
Other details: Hoping to negotiate for better TC
Hope to get you guys' opinions on the below
Overall, how is it for a job in Lux? What level do you think this is? Any chance for negotiation?
If I can't manage to nego the offer, net pay will end up around 4.2-4.5K/month (I realise the income tax is super heavy). Will this be a decent pay for a single person? Rent is around 1.5K+ and what about other living expenses?
How is it like to live in Lux? Is it happening and vibrant? Or quiet and stable?
How is data engineering like in Amazon? Judging from the interviews, the role is quite heavy on SQL and a bit on Python but not much on anything else. A bit limited imo. My background is more about building data platforms on open-source distributed systems. Any chance to expand the scope?
What is the common yearly hike for this role? I'm hoping it's gonna be at least 3%
