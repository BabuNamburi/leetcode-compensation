Experience : 9 yrs
Current Compensation : 40 lacs in India
I have good amount of experience in automating web, backend and mobile apps
Cleared all the rounds for turing.
How much can I ask from Turing? They would be looking to hire for some US client so I am not sure how much should I ask.
Could someone please help?
