Sorry for not posting the VMWare offer details but I am yet to get them after clearing the interview. Will post it sooner. I thought of MTS3 is my scale and asked for about 30+ package based on other compensation details. But they told its too high and it will be total of. around 25 LPA as CTC (I am not sure yet if this is including retirals/joining, no breakup yet). Doesn't seem there is a room for negotiation. Manager seemed furious for pay ask but very keen in knowing if i am accepting the offer. I feel they are playing low ball game. Should I interview somewhere else? Will I get offer letter only if I accept compensation breakup?
