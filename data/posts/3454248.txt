I'm not able to decide if I should accept the offer or not considering below points:
How is WLB and job stability currently at zoom?
How is growth and learning?
Will it be safe to move from Walmart to Zoom given the current market?
Is it a low ball offer from zoom considering my YOE?
Please help me to provide some insight on those points.
Thanks you!
