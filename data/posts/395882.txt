I love my current job and I have great work life balance. Honestly I'm not sure if i should take it. I told recruiter no and this is not what I want so she's gonna adjust maybe bonus a bit but won't be too much different than what it is now.
Salary is not much higher so I'm really doubting. Only reason I would join is to have it on my resume for future potential of getting hired. Driving me crazy not sure if i should accept but leaning towards yes even though my current job is amazing.
