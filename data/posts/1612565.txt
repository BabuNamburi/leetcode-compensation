Hi,
I am 2021 graduate in computer science from Tier 3 college currently working in one of the india's top service based company/MNC. I joined the company 5 months back and currently working in support project which is a call center job and with no relation to coding/development. I don't like this job and has no growth in it. I really want to work as a software engineer in a product based company.
what should I do next?
leave the job and work on upskilling myself?
take at least 1 year experience in this comapany?
What should be the best option for my career?
