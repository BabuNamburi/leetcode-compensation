{"text": "Education: Btech Tier 3\nYears of Experience: 3 years\nPrior Experience: MNCs, Startup\nDate of the Offer: April 2021\nCompany: Paypal\nTitle/Level: SDE 2\nLocation: Bangalore\nSalary: INR 19L\nRelocation/Signing Bonus: 1.5L\nStock bonus: 4.2L per year for 3 years\nBonus: 2L\nTotal comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): INR 26.7L\nBenefits: General perks around insurance, medical claims etc.\nThis seems like a lowball to me as per my expectations, Can anyone help me to confirm if someone has joined recently as a SDE 2 and what have you been offered? I was expecting the base to be atleast 22+ L.\nAlso, would you suggest to join Walmart (Bangalore) over Paypal if they offer slightly more than Paypal? I don't have the numbers yet but let's say INR 2-3L more. You can also give feedback regarding work and culture.\nThanks!"}
