I am switching my job because the work here is not interesting and sometimes becomes hectic because the existing codebase is very hastily written, there's some rewrites happening but nothing so good worth staying.
I want to ask how's the work culture in wayfair bangalore, they're hiring very aggresively in India, will that be an issue later on? Like hire to fire kind of? All the employees are mostly new basically so there's not much reviews on culture. If anyone has any inputs it'll be great.
