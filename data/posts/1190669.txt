I recently joined amazon 4 weeks ago. But, I've decided to leave amazon and join paypal as i don't like the work and the process followed. Please suggest me if it's a good move ?
I was informed by the manager that re-hire could be difficult as i'll be leaving amazon without significant contribution.
