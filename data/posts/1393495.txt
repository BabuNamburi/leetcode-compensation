Hi all, what salary can I expect in Bangalore for 5 yoe and a masters from abroad? The figures here include ESOPS/RSU's, but I'm in a conversation with a company that only offers a fixed component (got to know this after a few interviews). Can I just state the CTC as I see here? I am still applyig to other companies, and this one is getting to comp stages.
If anyone can help me with good companies for designers that have a decent wlb- I'd appreciate that. Thanks.
