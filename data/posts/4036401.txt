I performed really well in all the rounds and was asking HR to schedule few more rounds for a SDE 2 check but they denied being a 2022 grad. I wanted to understand how this offer really is. Are they lowballing me. HR keeps mentioning that the company is planning to for an IPO soon, and the stock options they're offering will potentially yield significant wealth in the future. Instead of increasing my base, she increased the ESOPS. Would love to hear your opinion on this
