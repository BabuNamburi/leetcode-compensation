Education: B.E in Computer Science
Years of Experience: 5 years 4 months
Company: Walmart
Title/Level: Software Enigeer IN3
Location: Bengaluru, India
Salary: 28.3 Lakh INR
Relocation/Signing Bonus: 1 Lakh INR
Stocks: 4 Lakh INR as RSU
Variable: Upto 5 Lakh based on Performance
Total comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): I am not sure how to calculate this part.
Should it be 28.3 + 1 + 4 + 5 as 38.3
or since I can only sell 25 percent of RSU per year, should it be:
28.3 + 1 + 1 ( RSU to sell for first year) + 5 ( Not sure if I will get variable this year ) = approx 30 to 35 ( based on variable pay)
Benefits: Normal Walmart benefits
Other details: I currently hold an offer from another firm for 26 LPA as based, 1 lakh joining bonus and 5 lakh in ESOPS
I am also getting offers from other companies, but I havent recieved any final offers from others to show Walmart. Can I ask Walmart to wait for a week, to have a better counter offer. HR said they need an answer as soon possible and not sure whether they will wait for me to have a better counter offer. Any advices?
If I had interviewd Walmart a little later, I could have had better counter offers. Any tips on how to tackle this with HR and get more time from them before accepting this?
Also, what will be my right CTC in the above scenario?
