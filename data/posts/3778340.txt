Interview Experience
I told the recruiter at the first day only when she reached out to me that i need 16/17 fixed.
But when I cleared the interview she told me that you told 13/14 fixed , I have written (A white lie).
Although I tried to negotiate but I did not had any counter offer so I am not able to negotiate even for a penny .
Please provide me with the correct idea to negotiate :(.
Thanks
