Career Questions
How hard is it to switch to an SDE 2 role from a Quant Role in 2 Years? Does it depend on the previous role or having sufficient knowledge of CS Concepts, Competitive Coding, System design and relevant tech is Good enough?
I wanted to know what are the cons of going for Quant role as a lot of my corporate experience is in Software Development?
How is WLB comparable for Both Companies?
What is the Career path for a Quantitative Analyst?
Education Qualifications - BTech in Computer Science (Tier 1 Institute in India)
