Introduction:
Maximizing profit in stock trading is a common goal. Today, we'll look at two approaches for the classic problem of deciding the best time to buy and sell stocks: a straightforward brute force method and a more efficient dynamic programming solution.
Brute Force:
Imagine exploring every possible combination of buy and sell days. It works, but it's like checking every nook and cranny. This method takes O(n^2) time, examining every pair of days to find the best trading window.
Let's outline the steps of the efficient dynamic programming approach:
Initialize variables min_price to positive infinity and max_profit to zero.
Iterate through the prices array:
a. Update min_price to the minimum of its current value and the current day's price.
b. Update max_profit to the maximum of its current value and the profit obtained by selling at the current day's price minus min_price.
This approach has a time complexity of O(n), making it more scalable for larger datasets.
Dynamic Programming:
Now, think smarter. Track the minimum price as you go and calculate potential profits. Update the maximum profit, and voila! This approach takes only O(n) time, like navigating through the data once to find the best opportunity.
Conclusion:
In the stock profit game, you have choices. The brute-force method is like turning over every stone, while dynamic programming is like following a smart path. Dynamic programming is the winner, especially when dealing with a lot of stock prices. It's like finding the treasure without exploring every corner. Happy trading!
