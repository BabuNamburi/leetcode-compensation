Education: B.Tech - TIER 3

Prior Experience: Startup
Salary: 45L Fixed
Relocation/Signing Bonus: 40k relocation
Stock bonus: 23L vested over 4 years. (10-20-30-40)

Don't mean to sound modest/greedy, but is this a decent enough offer? I feel like, no signing/performance bonus is a bit of miss.
Would love to hear some advice/thoughts! Thanks
