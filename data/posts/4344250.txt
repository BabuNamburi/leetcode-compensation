Other details: Confused whether to take this offer or not. Not having any other offer as of now to negotiate. My current org has been giving 40%+ hike every year and I expect the same in March 2024 as well. So my base will more or less become same in a few months. The new HR says they might consider me in their appraisals that are due in June 24. Current org is 5 days a week with 1 day wfh, new org 5 days a week with 2 days wfh. I am also planning to start preparing for GMAT asap and I'd need some study time every single day in order to prepare well. And 2 hours of classes MWF late at night. Switch or no?
