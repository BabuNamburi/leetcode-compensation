I didn't have to negotiate much but I did have a competing offer from MSFT. Probably, I could have negotiated upwards of 300k but felt tired due to weekend lmao\nWill post my onsite experience soon but it involved a few ML system design questions and a few LC mediums. More than half of my interviews were them grilling me on Amazon Leadership Principles (like I had two 1-hr interviews full of LPs lol) This is super-important if anyone is wondering.\nMy LC stats: 200 mediums, 200 hards. But this didn't affect much because there were only 2-3 simple LC-mediums in my interview. I solved them in like <7 mins each."}
