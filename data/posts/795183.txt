Education: Ph.D. in Physics
Years of Experience: None
Prior Experience: None
For fresh grad, any related Internship/coop experience? I performed as a SWE for a Startup back in 2018 for a year, as a part time job. My physics research included the developing of some software to process experimental data
Date of the Offer: August 2020
Company: Google
Title/Level: L4 Software Engineer
Location: Tokyo, Japan
Salary: ï¿¥10.000.000 (around $100.000 USD)
Relocation/Signing Bonus: None
Stock bonus: $84,000 USD vesting over 4 years
Bonus: 15%
Total comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock) ~ $136.000 USD
Benefits: usual Google stuff: free meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner), health insurance, retirement plan, gym, partial reimbursement for any kind of class or lesson I decide to take, $800 USD in wellness, 10 days of paid vacations (since, according to the recruiter, Japan has a lot of holidays -which is, well, true), and maybe some others I am forgetting
Other details: didn't find out I was L4 until I discussed the offer with my recruiter. I was happy with the offer for an L3 position, but after the discussion I felt like I was lowballed. On the other side, I was crazy busy with my Ph.D. dissertation, so I didn't spend too much applying somewhere else. Moreover, some other companies to which I did apply or was planning to entered into a hiring freeze due to the pandemic, so, well, that gave me zero competing offers. I did tried to negotiate, aiming for an increase in the stock bonus (which is where they are usually more flexible), but my recruiter was very clear that they just didn't have enough data to justify a raise, which I understand. The only option left is to provide the needed data through my performance at the job.
