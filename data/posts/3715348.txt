Hi Community,
I am in discussion about the offer from a mid-size startup (900+ people), details below :
Job Title : SE2
Expected offer they'll be making : Base - 28 LPA
Other components - Nothing
Current Job:
Company - MNC
CTC - 30+ LPA (16 Base, 13+ Stocks, 5 JB)
YOE - 2 Years
Education - CS from Tier-1 college
No other offers in hand to negotiate.
PLEASE Help me out with the pointers to negotiate and what should I expect and settle for. How should I negotiate. As in my current company, there is no growth in terms of compensation so I'm looking forward to change as well.
Any leads would be really helpful!
Thanks.
