I was laid off from my previous organization, so could not negotiate for more, initially they promised 33.23 base but later reduced it to 31(is this a red flag?).
There are some uncertanities around Sumo as they were recently acquired by Fransisco Partners.
Any suggestions, id it safe to join Sumo at this point?
