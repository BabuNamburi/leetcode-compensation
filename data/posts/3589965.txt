Hello Leetcode community,
Need some advice on a compensation related issue.
I work for a startup as a Lead.
My org has recently hired a lot of new candidates from quite a few reputed companies.
And I recently got to know, from other colleagues, that these new hires are being paid more than me.
The thing which makes me feel like shit is that I am an 8YOE candidate and they have around 5-6YOE.
If that is not enough, look below:
I definitely definitely add more value than these new hires whether it be in terms of tech design, PR reviews, confusion resolution etc.
I handle multiple teams and they are working as part of 1 team.
I delivered 2 high pressure projects recently.
I am leading couple of 2 new projects where nobody has a fucking clue about what needs to be done and they have nothing under their belt so far.
I feel extremely extremely shitty when I hear that I am being paid less than them whereas I contribute more to the org in any way you look at it.
When they come to me for PR reviews and technical advice, I feel even more shittier about the fact that I being the reviewer get paid less than the reviewee.
This is eating me up on a daily basis. My mind automatically goes to that unfairness if I sit idly for more than 10 minutes.
Can anybody advice me on what can I do in this situation.
