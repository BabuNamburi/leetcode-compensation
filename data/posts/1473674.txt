Hi,
I had compensation discussion with Microsoft HR. The compensation offered is on the lower side. I have around 7+ Years of experience. MS is offering L61 level.
Offer:
Base - 23LPA
Joining - 1LPA
Relocation - 1LPA(I am located in Bengaluru)
Stock - $25K
Other - Standard MS benefits.
Now, I feel it is difficult for me to negotiate MS offer because my current is around 15LPA. I thought of trying to ask HR for L62 but that is unlikely(since their response will be that it is decided based on interviews & there is no way I can counter that argument).
At the same level(L61), what could be other points I could mention in negotiation for better base & stock? I do not have any competing offer at the moment, but MIGHT get offer from Salesforce(SMTS, Bengaluru location).
Any suggestions.
