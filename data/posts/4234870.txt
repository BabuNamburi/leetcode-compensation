Interview experience was rigorous and fun.
Data Structures questions asked in ~3 rounds. Some tree questions involving common ancestor algorithm, some string algorithms for reversal with keeping spaces as they were.
Questions also asked from Compiler Design background (prove if a given language is regular, asked to talk a bit about pumping lemma), Probability (somewhere in b/w puzzle and theory)
Asked to write a C++ singleton (thread safe). Mutex etc. involved. (C++ was my language of choice) - Enjoyed this the most :)
Decision: (not taken yet, any suggestions are helpful)
Parameters:
OCI:
Work in OCI would be a lot of support (/improving stuff coming from pagers). Not the most interesting work, but it depends.
Growth might be slow, as I might join early IC3, will take 3-4 years min for next promotion (keeping diplomacy in check).
Have heard good and bad things about work culture in OCI. A little hesitant.
Money is good, but not the only thing that should matter?
Not sure if I'll get some window of 3-4 hours for myself in a day.
Current startup:
Current startup's work is good, culture is good as well.
Good visibility on work among the team and leadership.
Lots of customers already, so customer facing work is also there.
Growth is medium paced, depends on me honestly :)
I get time to do a lot of Open Source, and personal projects.
