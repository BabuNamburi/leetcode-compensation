Hi Friends,
Hope you are all doing good.
I recently received summer 2021 internship offers from these companies(salesforce, microsoft, cisco). I would like to know which one you suggest me to go with among the 3 offers.
Here is what they are offering:
Microsoft and cisco pay the same stipend but salesforce pays around $6000 more when compared to the other two. Work/Team wise, teams where I will be a part of during the internship do have good work that I like.
I would like to know your opinion regarding the work culture, internship conversion rate(to a mid level position as I have 2 years of work experience) as I am not a big fan of brand.
Hope you will me make a right decision.
Thanks in advance!!
