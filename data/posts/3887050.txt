Hi everyone,
I am 2023 passout. I interned at Amazon for 6 months but didn't get PPO due to headcount unavailability . I am actively looking for jobs from past two months but couldn't find any opportunities. As there are many interns worked in the same timeline , I would like to know if anyone are able to find jobs . It would be a great help if you can post your job searching journey. It will help many people like me.
