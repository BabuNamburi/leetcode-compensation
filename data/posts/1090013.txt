YOE: 11
Initial offer
Base pay: 50 LPA
RSU: 100K USD(vested for periord of 4 years)
Annual bonus: 15LPA(upto 30% of base.. but heard that it is just theoritical though we perform well we will get max 15% of base which is 7.5 L)
Refresher stock up to 40K USD
Joining bonus: nil
After negotiation:
Base:52 LPA
RSU 115K USD
rest same.
I am not satisfied with this number. I expected more RSU and joining bonus. I also said that to HR but he cut short me and said this is final. I am in dilemma.. should I accept this offer or reject. I dont have any other offer in hand.
