Negotiation
I asked for 20 LPA in base, as I had a competing offer for 24 LPA (fixed) from Altimetrik, my recruiter checked for negotiation and they are not ready to increase my base.
I know it is a low balled offer, what's your idea on this whether I can join Walmart and swtich after a year ? or I can join Altimetrik and look out for better opportunities after 6 months or a year ? or skip both ?
Also, can you guys shed some light on Walmart's variable component, how much I can get as an average hike?
