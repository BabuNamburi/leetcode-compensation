Other details: Was given 2 business days to sign. Declined due to the unreasonable deadline and having better offers. Slight adjustment to salary and signing bonus (base 140k to 142k and 1st year signing from 40k to 45k) because I had to relocate but they couldn't give relocation bonus. Tried to negotiate with other offers (200k+) but they did not budge.
