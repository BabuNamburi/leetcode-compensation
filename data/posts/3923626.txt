I recently got an offer from a big tech company and there was a bit of back and forth with the recruiter about the compensation. I am experienced and have switched a few times but I never had a discussion about comp with the hiring manager. but because of the delay in acceptance the hiring manager wants to talk to me (he worded it as if I have any questions about the team).
I don't know if I should discuss the compensation with the manager but I cannot push the recruiter anymore. The whole interview process will be a waste because they are not giving me a significant hike on my current.
In India do people go for comp discussion with hiring manager? is this frowned upon?
