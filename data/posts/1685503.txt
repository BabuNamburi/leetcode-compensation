Hi Leetcode community,
I would like to seek some help to evaluate a couple of offers. The details are as follows:-
College - Tier 1 in India
YOE - 2.5
Current Comp - 27 lpa
International offer
Bloomberg London
Position - Software Engineer
Base - 75k GBP
Bonus - 5k GBP
Relocation Bonus - 7k GBP
Indian Offer
Stealth Startup (Can't reveal the name)
Position - Senior Software Engineer
Base - 40 lpa
Bonus - 5 lpa
Total Comp - 45 lpa
I would like to get some help in evaluating both the offers and does it make sense to stay back in India given that India has some great opportunities in terms of tech companoes these days or shall I go ahead and take the Bloomberg London's offer.
It would be great if you could share some thoughts in terms of financial aspects, learning, growth etc.
