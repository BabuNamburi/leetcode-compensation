Currently: 2020 graduate. React Native developer with 2 years relavant exp. CTC 20lpa in service based organisation.
Having said that, I am considering joining Scaler Academy, but I am confused because I cannot decide. I've also listed the advantages and disadvantages below.
Pros:
Systematic learning curriculum
1:1 Mentoring
Easy referral because they have excellent relationships with product companies
Salary negotiating. They know how much one can ask for.
Cons:
I know I can learn on my own because I've done it before, but not at the same speed. Even though I can afford to pay 2.5 lakhs, I believe the fees are excessive because:
a. If everything is available on the internet, why should I pay for it?
b. Will not get ROI on my current CTC.
I know that if I join, I will only pay for their networking and salary negotiation skills because they know how much one can ask for. I'd appreciate it if anyone could assist me with this.
Please help is it really worth it to join?
