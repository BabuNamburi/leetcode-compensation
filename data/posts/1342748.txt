Hi All,
I have been offered a role with Oracle OCI, following are the details for the same. Would like to know the reviews, first hand experience, and had some questions in my mind.
YoE: ~8 years
Base: 40 LPA (includes PF, Gratuity)
Sign-on: 4 L (for 2 years)
Stocks: 600 units (~9 L /year)
Total comp: 38 + 2 + 9 = 49 LPA
Prev TC: 28LPA + 8L (stocks for 4 years) + 3L (yearly bonus)
Competing offer: 37 + 6 L (sign on for 2 years) + 0 Stocks
Is the offer competitive? Do you think I should accept this offer?
I see lot of posts where people have drawn even 45+ (base) + 1200-1500 stock units as well, some of them had good current compensation and some of them had good competing offers as well. Please let me know the best option I can go for?
I will be writing a detailed post on my journey with leetcode.
I will be writing detailed posts on all my interview experiences.
Many thanks to this amazing community.
