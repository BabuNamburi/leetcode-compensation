Need suggestions wrt to culture, work & numbers . Adobe tech stack matches with my current stack (Java+). Akamai can have golang & python. What would be best in current market scenario(lay offs + inflation) & for the future ?. Can't negotiate much on numbers as both are very close. No idea on refresher stocks, HR's haven't committed anything in both the companies.
Also adobe share is trading at higher valuation(P/E & P/S) compared to akamai so upside can be minimal. I beilive investing in Indian stocks for the next decade. Adobe can still have some run due to AI tag. I'm also fine with WFO or WFH.
