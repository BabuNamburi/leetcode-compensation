Other details: Work is pretty laid back, but not great company WFH policy. SWE's generally have it better, depending on your manager. My interview was at 8am on a monday morning and did not go amazingly well. Didn't negotiate my offer because the recruiter said that they almost didnt give me an offer and i got timid on the call, overall pretty happy since it was a 60% pay raise for me
