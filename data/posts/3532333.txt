BTech from Tier 1
Date of offer: December 2022
Type of Offer: On campus
Compensation: 87k + 10k relocation = INR 97k
Query: I recently got a 6 month off campus internship for amazon, which can be extended for 12 months if possible. But I will not be able to sit for college placements if I decide to go for Amazon. I am in a dilemma, but I am inclined to work with amazon due to marginally better compensation, growth and better tech stack than Cisco(maybe?). Is it worth taking the risk and going to Amazon, given the current situation?
TIA
