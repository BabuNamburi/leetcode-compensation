Interview experience is good, Bad HR experience
HR Ghosted me after giving above offer verbally, and ready to offer 2 lakhs Joining Bonus.
After 2 weeks they called again and check if i am ready to join them as now i am a immediate Joiner, they will ready to offer me joining bonus which i denied
Had a terrible experience, i wasted my time and effort in interviewing with them and ghosted. Now, they again come back and expected me to come in same package. I dont know what kind of HR in the company, really doubt about the culture there after this incident
