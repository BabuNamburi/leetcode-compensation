I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek clarification regarding the methodology used in our company for calculating annual increments.
Increment Percentage Basis: Could you please explain how the annual increment percentage is determined? Specifically, is it based on the difference between the total compensation (TC) of the last year and the current year? By current year, I am referring to the inclusion of performance bonuses which are typically received at the end of the fiscal year.
Inclusion of Stocks: Additionally, I am curious to know whether stock options are considered in the increment calculation. Since the value of stocks can fluctuate, including them could potentially affect the increment percentage. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where a significant portion of stock vests in the initial years, such as in Google where the majority of stocks are vested in the first two years. This situation could result in a scenario where the total compensation in the third or fourth year might not show a substantial increase, possibly leading to a minimal or even negative increment percentage.
Understanding these details is crucial to have a clear picture of the compensation structure and its progression over the years. Your assistance in providing detailed information on these aspects would be greatly appreciated by the community.
Please respond by mentioning your companya and then the annual increment/performance bonus details...
