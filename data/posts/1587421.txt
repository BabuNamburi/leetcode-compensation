I interview with Google a year ago. I was targeting L4 position but was downgraded to L3. They didn't have an open L3 possition back then and I ended up with accepting an offer from another big thech company: Senior Software Engineer with 265K TC.
Google recently reached out to me with the following offer:
YOE: ~8
Position: L3
Base: 145K
Bonus: 15%
Sign-in bonus: 25K
Location: Sunnyvale
Team/Project: GCP
Is it worth giving up my current SSE role and ~270k TC for L3 position at Google ?
How quickly I can get L4 promotion or I should try to interview for L4 again ?
Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you
