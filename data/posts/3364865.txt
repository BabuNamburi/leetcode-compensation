I have been offered the role of a full time Analyst in JP Morgan Chase's Software Engineering Program. The basic annual salary is 37k, with a one time relocation bonus of 3.5k. I come from a developing country hence my visa is sponsored by them. I need to know if this salary is enough for me to live there?
