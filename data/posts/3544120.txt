Curr Exp: ~ 4years
CTC ~ 33 LPA (30 base + 3 variable)
Role : SDE2
I have two offers:
Nykaa : CTC 38 = 30(base) + 3(bonus) + 3(joining) + 2(retention)
Allen Digital : CTC - 43 = 37 base + 4(variable) + 2(joining bonus)
Is there any scope of negotiation ?
I am confused as to which one to go for.
So I need some suggestions.
Kindly advise.
Thanks
