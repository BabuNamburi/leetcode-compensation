Others from my college got offers from Browserstack, Microsoft, Amazon etc. I know I have done very poorly because of the following factors :
No comp. programming during college.
Started leetcode practice very late.
Focused only on DSA and OOP only.
Currently studying CS Fundamentals (OS, DBMS, Comp. Networks) and tough topics like DP and Graphs. Will try and switch after a year.
