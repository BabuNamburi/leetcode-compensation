I joined omnicell as SDE-V and implemented (Designed/Developed) scheduler-service from scratch.
contributed close to 1.4 years, Worked very hard day & night to build the product. Later on laid off the person who build service from scratch.
This company is very old around 30 year old but in india they started this center 1.5 years back only.
There is no HR policy in india, And it's purely startup culture here.
I am clearing calling out the people name here so no one enter into trap of this organization.
Ved Prakash Singh-> Vice-President of india team. ->
who is mainly driving the india team working style is giving unexpected task to finsh
in expected timeframe , if in case not completed then started shouting on ppl in front of everyone.
since there is no HR policy so he got right to shout on team in front of everyone.
Damodara Reddy Gosula-> senior manager
he just only play around jira (creating/assignjing jira's).
he never take any feature responsibility, and not contribute in any design decision making.
Always ask developer to own everything, And when things goes wrong he simply put question to developer.
very good in observing like not coming to office, not speaking in team meeting.overall good in playing blame game.
overall there is quartely rating which would decide weather you would continue in organization or not.
if you get 2 rating consecutively then you are gone!.
Please avoid to join this organization as much as you can and go for other offer, if possible.
one more thing. variable pay and stock part is worst.
consider quartetly variable pay as 50% only.
Thanks!
