Can anyone give me some tips to increase concentration? When I'm solving a question, I tend to get distracted.
I use the pomodoro method with a 40-minute time limit.
I need your serious help.
I'm a beginner, and when I see a question, my first thought is, "Let's see the answer," and then I go to see the answer, and I have no control over myself.
Your serious help is needed, guys.
Thank you in advance.
