Hi,
Can someone with tech world experience give suggestion on this dilemma.
I got offer in PwC for internal project for 6.7 lpa and Manhattan Assoc for 10LPA. in manh, even though its product company, the role was for client specific changes in their product SCALE. I plan to switch in a year or so and I am only having 2.5 year experience overall. I come from a Tier-3 college. I plan to prepare for Microsoft, Paypal etc.
