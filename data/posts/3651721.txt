I have a total experience of around 8 years and have worked for a couple of firms in my entire career - both big tech companies. But my current TC is only ~20lpa as of now. I guess I became lazy at some point and got accustomed to the perks of these firms and didn't try to look for other options outside.
I have recently started looking at the compensations offered by various companies for my yoe on leetcode and my eyes have permanently widened ever since! I don't know what to do now as the current economic situation is also not good and I don't think I'll get calls from very many companies given the lack of gettings-your-hands-dirty experience I should have had in 8 years.
Need some advice (motivation?) from the community on how to plan a switch given the current market conditions. I am very feeling low right now - it feels like I had been living in my own fantasy world, while others have risen so far ahead of me!
