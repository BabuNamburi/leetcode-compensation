Hi community members,
I am expecting an offer from Walmart SDE-3 for backend developer role. I am in final phases of interviews.
experience: 4.2 years
current salary: 14lpa +-(50K)
tech: java , springboot
Initially when hr contacted me and asked what are your salary expectations , I told I am expecting the industry/company standard salary. At that time she told during final hr round of interviews you have to give your expectations if qualified successive rounds. Now that since i have qualified the technical , system design , HM round need this information asap.
Can i ask for 35 lpa as Base salary ?
I just don't want to miss out on the offer just because of asking too much as base salary. Glassdoor/ambition box suggests expected base ranges from 25lpa to 30lpa . I am planning to be here for long time, so want to get as high base as possible. Walmart assoicates please guide. (No other competing offers)
