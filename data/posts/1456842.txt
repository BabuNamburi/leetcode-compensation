Competing offer: I did not have any competing offer, but I was interviewing with 5-7 other organisations at the time and the interview processes were almost towards the last few rounds for most of them. Plus, I knew I had done well in the Morgan Stanley interviews and the team was happy and excited to onboard me. I managed to negotiate such an attractive offer on the basis of these two factors.
