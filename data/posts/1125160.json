Had to code the rest in front of the interviewer. Solid focus on OOPS and a production ready code. Gojek is a stickler for unit tests / TDD so make sure you prioritize it\nLLD Medium 1.5 hours. Explain past projects and its arch in detail. Describe the LLD for an event ingestion framework. Why I chose what I chose. Gave one medium problem on trees Then gave a new problem for which LLD had to be drawn neatly. Focus was given on domain design and entity modelling and even Leadership principles at Gojek.\nSystem Arch / Design Medium Met a very friendly guy. Really expressive. Had to design something something like a location tracking system which scales to 1M users in a geographical region. Open ended. He asked me about what I would change at my current company.\nHiring Manager Hard Oh, this was hard. One of the hardest Hiring Manager rounds. He went in depth on my career, my decisions, why Gojek, debate on functional vs non functional paradigms, Gojek's focus on Clojure, why projects fail, why is software architecture different from construction architecture, how can you improve, what can you change. This really was one of the best HM's for me."}
