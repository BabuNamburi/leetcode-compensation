Hi All,
I have been in the industry for about 7 years now. I have been working in the same company after college till now, but now I have started feeling being underpaid. I have been working on the company's proprietary language and tech so now I have started feeling that I might not be a good fit for the current market. Lately, I have been pursuing javascript for DSA, frontend as well as backend and I do feel confident in it as I have made some of my side projects in it.
After seeing posts of people making 40-50-60LPA at my experience, I get a feeling of being unsure whether I would be able to make upto that or not, my current compensation being 18LPA.
I was looking for some guidance from your side in order to achieve my goal and also to understand if me being working on javascript a good decision or not in order to change my job, as I have been enjoying working with javascript.
Thanks in advance to all.
