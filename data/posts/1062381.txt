Other details: Having a competing offer really helps in bumping up the compensation. I was able to get this much because had a competing offer of SDE2 level in another company. Microsoft HR's ask for salary slips and based on your current earnings and whether you have a competing offer, they will decide your level. Last year I got SWE1, L60 because didn't have any competing offers.
