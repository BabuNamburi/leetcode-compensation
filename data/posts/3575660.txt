How I got job on freelance
One day, I said to myself, that I wanna do something, I wanna work, but not full-day, cause I am stydying at school rn, so I decided to sign up on freelance and find job in there. I spent like 2 hours finding and responding to tasks, then one person wrote me back, and said that he has a job for me. I should wrote frontend and API of kinda small mobile application on Flutter. So I did. Than that person gave me bigger project with double salary. Same thing, flutter, frontend, API.

So what I wanna say
Is that if you have a lot of free time and you love coding and ready to do some tasks which will require some time, go on and find a job, freelance is a good place to do it, you should try to find some tasks that you want to do and respond to them, there is always a chance that employer will choose you, I guess in my case reason why I was chosen is that employer wanted projects to be finished as fast as possible, and I have 100+ WPM typing speed, I wrote it in my resume, and got a job. Your reason may be different, but you should write in resume about any your good qualities. Good luck with finding a job
