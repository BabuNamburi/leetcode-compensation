Hi Guys,
I got one offer from Zomato for SDE-2 role at their Gurgaon office and other one at GoJek Bangalore. I am literally confused which one to choose.
Current Location :- Bangalore
Past Exp - Product based startup
YoE :- 2
Current Compensation :- 17
Zomato SDE-2
Base Pay :- 25 L
and other standard benefits
GoJek Software Engineer - L2
Base Pay :- 24 L
and other standard benefits
Any suggestions will help me in deciding. My mind is really tired of thinking.
Edit :- Joined GoJek.
Zomato's VP is worse, rude and was more like - "Mein tujhe paise de rha hu kaam kar warna fire ho jayga aage jakar" - this mindset. He straight said this if you are not bringing anything new you will get no appraisals, but sometimes it is not possible for everyone. And Found out that Zomato has not at all good WLB. They have very high expectations from every employee which if someone doesn't satisfy, they fire.! So Decided to go with GoJek.
