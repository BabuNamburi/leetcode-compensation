Something that Google has supposedly changed in their interview process is having applicants interview with different product teams before their technical interview are reviewed. I had a good interview with one of the manager and they were willing to hire me on their team. I was told that having a manager that was willing to hire me significantly improved my chances going into the Hiring Committee Review.
