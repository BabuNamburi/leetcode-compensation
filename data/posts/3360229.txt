Hi, I am from Tier-3 college and going to graduate in next 2 months. Currently, I am having 2 offers from TCS and Capgemini. I am confused which role to choose. Please help me out.
I am providing details of both companies:
TCS
CTC:7,60,000
Post: TCS Digital
Bond : 6 months
Capgemini
CTC:7,50,000
Post: Senior Software Engineer/ Senior Analyst
Bond : 0
PS: I am having a 2000+ rating on Leetcode and have solved 1200+ problems. So, will try to switch to a Product-based company once this recession is over.
