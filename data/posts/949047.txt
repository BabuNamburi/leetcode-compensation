Offer Details:

Years of Experience: 2.4
Prior Experience: Full stack developer at a e-commerce company
Date of the Offer: 11/23
Company: Microsoft (ODSP)
Title/Level: L61, SDE II
Location: Seattle/Redmond, WA
Salary: $131,000
Relocation: $8,000
Signing Bonus: $25,000 over two years
Stock bonus: $50K stock grant vested over 4 years
Bonus: Performance-based bonus up to 20% of salary every year, target: 10%
Total comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): ~$170K first year (not including relocation)
Other details: Tried to negotiate once, they have not got back to me yet. The recruiter said it's easy to bump the bonus up to 30k and stock up to 60k, still quite a low ball offer. I was targeting at bonus 40k and stock ~120k or a base of 135k but with 100k stocks (looks like MSFT is not generous to industrial hires on granting stocks).
