I've been told that curefit gives hike in every 6 months and 99% folks get it around 10%
Is the info correct / accurate?
No titles in curefit | flat hierarchy.
curefit ESOPs are barely of any use. Company have never done any buybacks and I don't think they'll even think for IPO in next 7-8 years. Hence, this is just paper money.
My Priority:
Pay >= Engineering work (Good problems to solve) > WLB and culture matters > company brand (help me for next switch :) > smart folks in the team
Edit1: As of now I am inclined towards joining Curefit. Scale is high but comparatively lower than Razorpay. But their is considerable monetory difference (after 3 yrs) , which I don't want to miss :) But again, will decide in before EOW.
Edit2:
Base/Fixed (Calculating based on standards given by each company) as many people might not consider monetory motivation for these offers.
Razorpay(base+variable) -- Taking avg 12% for Razorpay
Y1 ~42.9LPA
Y2 ~47.9LPA
Y3 ~52.9LPA
Y4 ~ 59LPA
CureFit (Taking 10% for CureFit in every 6 months)
Y1: 45LPA
Y2: 52.6LPA
Y3: 60LPA
Y4: 70LPA
Edit3: Other offers:
GoJek (~57LPA total compensation)
I have learnt that GoJek transport team is also very good, also the culture is good in GoJek. The only problem is attrition is high (which I believe is everywhere)
Hence, the decision now becomes more difficult :P
Edit4:
Curefit revised offer
Base: 42L
JB: 5L
Esops: 20L
TC : ~51 LPA/year
Rejected Razorpay as the pay was quite less and team was not exciting. I had to work on migration part from PHP -> Go. Need to decide between Gojek & CureFit. Work at Gojek is in transport team (Uber/Ola) and I'll will be working on a new project from scratch.
Requesting leetcode fam to help :)
