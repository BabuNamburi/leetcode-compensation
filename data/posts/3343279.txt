Hi fellow members, need your guidance.
Can you please rate my compensation on a scale of 10 as average, good, bad, very bad etc. considering my experience and other details shared below. Whenever i am asking my manager/team members about my salary how it is , they always say that it is excellent but from deep inside i am not feeling good about it.
I am working as a software engineer at a US based retail company. I will be completing 4 years in June2023 in IT industry. My tech stack mainly includes working with Java, Springboot, rest apis and company specific tools etc. I completed Btech in CS from a local college.
Current compensation(INR):
fixed: 13 lac
variable: 10% (mostly got around 1 lakh last year, they pay twice in a year, september and March)
hike(2023): 12%
Salary after hike , effective from April 2023
fixed: 14.5 lac
variable: 10%
Advice needed:
I am trying to switch from last 1 year but got only 2 interview calls and failed badly there. Work at my current company involves working with company specific tools , and not getting much development work. Even though my experience is around 4 years i have done very small small tasks and few bug fixes. At the same time my friends are already into good companies and getting 25lac as base salary and good development work. They are also saying that I will be facing difficulties in future while defending this 4YOE with almost little to no development work.
Is it good time for a guy like me who is desperate to move out and make a switch considering the current job market. Or shall I stay with my current company and wait for recession to get over probably 2024. I know for sure at my current company I won't get promoted to SSE in the next year also. Kindly help.
