I am currently holding 3 offers from JLLT, Fubo TV and OLA Electric. I am currently confused between Fubo and JLLT. I am looking at stabilty right now.
Current CTC - 58L (ESOP - 32L vested)
Company - Unicorn Startup
Role - Lead Engineer
Exp - 8yr
Laid Off in April, so was ok with any offer
JLL Technologies
Role - Senior Software Engineer
CTC - 53 base + 15% Performance Bonus + 5000$ RSU (3yr vesting)
WFH but require overlap with US hours.
Fubo TV
Role - Senior Software Engineer
CTC - 55L + 12% Performance Bonus (No ESOPS/RSU)
3Days work from office. May require some USA overlap.
OLA Electric
Role - SDE III
CTC - 58L (not sure of rest as I rejected it due to work culture concerns)
5days work from office
Rejected this due to work culture concerns
Also cleared Google L4 (down leveled from L5) which I was not happy about and anyways there were no openings for L4, so no offer. But valid for a year and I can apply again in 3months for L5.
