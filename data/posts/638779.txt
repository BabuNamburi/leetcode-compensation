Notes: Initial offer was lower. I tried to negotiate but was told they cap hike at 40% and will match other offer if I have any. So I rejected offer after that they come up with numbers posted here. Same company offered 32 LPA CTC (20 LPA TC) in NITs. I didn't like company's attitude and mentality of capping hike like indian service based companies so rejected offer.
