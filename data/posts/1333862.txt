Hi folks, I need some help and suggestions.
I am trying to negotiate with the recruiter on the offer for Salesforce for MTS with YOE 1 at Amazon.
Currently they are offering:
Base : 150k
Bonus : 10%
Sign On Bonus : Recruiter told, there is no sign on bonus? this seems little off - would love to hear thoughts from folks.
RSU: 100k vested over four years
No sign on bonus? is that a new trend at Salesforce?
Any thoughts would be appreciated.
