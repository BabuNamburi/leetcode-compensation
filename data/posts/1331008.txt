I have received offers from Tekion Corp and Zeta Suite. I am confused on what to choose among these. If anyone is working/has worked at these organisations or has some insights about these companies please comment on the post. Looking for details like learning curve, culture, appraisals, WLB, personal growth, future scope of company, ESOPs etc.
Years of experience : 3
Compensation is mostly same.
