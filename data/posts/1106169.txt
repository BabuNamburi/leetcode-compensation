I have offer from Intuit which is as follow
SDE-2
Base -> 22.5L
Bonus->2.25L
RSU-> 28 vesting over 4 years
Sign in Bonus- 2L one time
And In Dream 11
SDE-2
Base-> 30L
ESOP-> 3L vesting every year
I am mostly concerned about the kind of work that I would be doing in each of the firm, what would be my learning/ career growth if I chose one over the other and where would i get most opportunity to learn.
Thank you in advance for the help :)
