The selection process was a little lengthy with 2 levels of coding tests and that was followed by 2 Interviews (1 HR and 1 Technical)
Both the tests had 10 questions each and 2.5 hours to solve, where the first one was quite easy with 6 basic questions and 3 medium level and 1 hard. Anyone who cleared 6 questions was selected.
Total 45 students passed this test.
The round as a little tough with 3 easy, 4 medium and 3 hard questions
Anyone who solved 8 questions passed this one.
Only 4 students were selected for the next round.
Then there were 2 interviews. The HR was 15 minutes where the typical HR questions like strengths,goals,etc. were asked.
The technical one was a lenghty one. Questions on DSA were asked and there were 2 coding questions:
One was converting a BST to doubly Linked-List
A Map question (easy)
Finally 2 students were selected for the Intern and I was one of them.
I would prefer students to preppare from Leetcode as many questions were from here only.
