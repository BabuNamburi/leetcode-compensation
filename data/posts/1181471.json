I don't think this matters that much since your expected to be highly present at L5 and have more responsibilities.\nI ended up declining the offer but was very close to taking it; money isn't everything.\nI think a lot of people here focus on what to study to get offers like these but after a long time I found that the only things that are important are who you are as a person. Awesome people are the same people inside and outside of work.\nDeliver on promises\nMake good estimations\nBe emotionally intelligent\nBe a cogent communicator\nLeetcode is fun for me, not something to be studied uncomfortably\nHave an actual interest in technology. I spent many weekends doing side projects for years because I like it, not because I'm trying to climb a ladder"}
