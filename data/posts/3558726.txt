I am a fresher and have been interviewing for a fulltime role with a Bangalore based startup. After the interviews I was offered a compensation of 9lpa all in hand and after asking for a better deal the hr came back with 10lpa offer. The hiring manager has made clear that the role is demanding and you will be expected to work hard. In the current economic climate is the wise to accept the offer or should i push for 12-15 lpa range. My expected ctc was in 12-15 range , the lowest im willing to go is 12.
what are your thoughts ?
