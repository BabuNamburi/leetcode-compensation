Thoughts? Is it a good offer? I kind of think for SDE-3 base they cannot go any higher but not sure about the stocks. Also not sure if for paypal SDE-3 is better or shoud i ask for MTS - 1. Seems kinda difficult since i'm just on starting exp level for MTS-1 and the interview wasn't great. Also confused if i should consider the startup since it is giving much better base pay or paypal. But paypal stock has done well in recent times and it might have work at scale so kind of inclined towards it. Have kept a call with HM to have more clarity on work
