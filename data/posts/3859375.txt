Sometimes you can't control whats going around , I wanted to start with SDE role but ,
I luckily won IPad from Credit Suisse Global coding challenge 2022 for "Global Engagement Champion" ,
Then started youtube just because of IPad and created DSA content.
Got 2 Edtech offers when I didn't expected any.
