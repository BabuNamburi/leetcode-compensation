Round 3: 30 mins Resume Discussion (on projects) and 30 mins DSA round, they asked 1 hard question on binary search.
Round 4: System Design: Design an online ordering system where an online request (order) can go through multiple stages. Customer can cancel the order at initial stage but can't cancel at later stages. Customer should be able to see all the stages the order is going through. They asked a LLD for how would I implement the various stages that a product would go through, and implement a cancel feature at a given stage.
I explained them a HLD using queues and LLD using Chain of responsibility pattern.
Round 5: Hiring Manager Round: Asked me about my projects.
I solved all the DSA questions.
Verdict: Got the Offer.
