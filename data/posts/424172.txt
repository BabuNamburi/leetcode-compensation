As far as an interview loop went, I did not have one as I was an intern prior to joining. Here was my intern interview experience though:

1 hour phone screen (behavioral): Asked about previous projects, current school work, hackathons, prior internship experience. Had one quesiton about SNMP and another question with regards to the path finding, no coding.

Onsite, 7 flash rounds: Met with 7 potential managers and discussed their projects and how my interests aligned with the projects. These were all meant to be behavioural but one interviewer, whom was an SDE at Microsoft decided to ask me a coding question to solve on paper. I ended up getting a call to be his intern the day after (September 29, 2017)
Problem: Given an array of 1s and 0s and k-flips, find the largest window of 1s that you can create using some or all of the flips allowed.

My Solution: Window sliding algorithm
