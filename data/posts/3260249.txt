Hi Everyone,
Recently i have received an offer from ARM for grade 3 for the role Software Engineer
Below are the details:
Date: March 2023
CCTC - 19 LPA fixed
Current company - Product MNC
YOE - 5.5 years
ARM Offer :
Fixed - 23 LPA
Annual bonus: 2.3 LPA
Joining bonus - 5L
RSU - 30k (52% first year, 24% second year and 24% 3rd year)
CTC: 23+2.3+5+12.8 = 43L for first year
Is this a fair offer for 5.5 years as grade 4 should be provided for 5.5 YOE and hike in base is low? Is it lowballed?
