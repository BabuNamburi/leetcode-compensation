Total Years of Experience: 3.5 years
Current Compensation : 40LPA (29 base, 3 bonus, 8 RSUs)
Fivetran offer :
28L base
13L RSUs (over 4 years)
Hevo data offer :
38L base
3.8L bonus
4L joining bonus
10L ESOPs over 4 years
From a purely monetary aspect, Hevo is the clear winner.
However, I've read A LOT of negative reviews about Hevo and itâ€™s culture (Most of these are from last year, though)
On the other hand, I've heard really good reviews for Fivetran.
I would be willing to join Fivetran even though the offered compensation is essentially the same as what I'm currently drawing as I'm deeply dissatisfied with my current job for various reasons.
Please help me choose between the two based on your insights !
