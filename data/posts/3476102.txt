YOE : 2.6yrs
Current Comp : 21LPA (19 fixed)
Before Interview , I already did set my expectations(by doing background check) with recruiters that I am looking for fixed in range (26 - 28 LPA) and they were ok with that.
Round 1 (60 mins) : ds algo / problem solving
Round 2 (60 mins) : problem solving / LLD
Round 3 (90 mins) : CTO round
Got call the next day that I have been selected and HR discussion got scheduled. Also got mail to share the documents.
HR Round : I again set my expectations that I was looking for(26 - 28LPA fixed). They disagreed and said 20 % is the maximum hike (23 LPA fixed) they can offer, I tried negotiating to which they said they will talk to the management and come back with a number.
Next Day :
They come up with an offer with ctc : 22LPA (20. something was fixed).
I laughed out(inside) and asked is this a joke or what.
To which they said management has taken some decisions 1 week back and now this is what they can offer.
This again was surprising because all interviews happened within a week.
