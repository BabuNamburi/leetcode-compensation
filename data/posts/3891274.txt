About me: Fresher, 6M intern@ Amazon
I applied for IC2 role at Oracle.
I gave 6 rounds interview.
HR contacted and told me that you are selected and how much do you expect. I gave the usual figures that they give. She said that you have less experience and we wont give this much. I agreed. HR told that they will come with compensation soon.
I called them next day, they said they are working on it and asked me about other offers.
I again called next day, they told they will tell by evening.
Today, I called so they told me that hiring is stopped and they will contact me after 1 month.
Pleae tell me what to do next, or any tip on what to specifically ask!
Thanks
