Other details: Bad experience on negotiation also in general MS has very bad reputation to deal with candidates for negotiation, a small piece of advice would be to just say I've better offer and say thanks they will get back to you but if you sound weak then they will be very rude and harsh and wont increase a penny. I didnt get my offer months and had to send multiple mails requesting for offer which was a very bad experience.
