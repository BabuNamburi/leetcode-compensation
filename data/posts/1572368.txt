Interview Exp :
Round 1 : 1 Project (Complete a Medium Level End to End probem is Spring MVC using maven/gradle peoject). It was a difficult project and 1 week was given to complete it and submit the .jar file which will be run against the testcases
Round 2 : System Design HARD (Only HLD)(Solution need not to be optimal but should be logically correct)
Round 3 : System Design Medium (Only HLD )(Solution need not to be optimal but should be logically correct)
Round 4 : Culture Fitment
I did not prepare for System Design from anywhere. On the spot it somehow designed the required System using the concepts that I had learnt while working in my current Organisation .I felt really happy after correctly designing the System in both the rounds . Before this I always had a fear about System Design and I thought that I will never be able to crack any interviews as I am not prepared for System Design.
Lessons Learnt : There are you many things that you already know , its just that we dont have the confidence and we always want to be in a Comforte zone before doing anything . In life everything is like the situation when you learn about how to drive a car ; no matter how much training you have taken , you will feel confident only when you are alone driving the car without any external help. The day you do this,that fear will vanish.
Remember, no one is ever 100 percent ready for anything . Even if you know 50 percent of the things, you have to make sure that 50 percent you have is100 percent correct .
