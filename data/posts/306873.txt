Other details: Tried to negotiate, wasn't accepted. Interview process was phone screen, then webcam interview with coding in a code sharing software, then three rounds on-site same day (first two technical - each 1hr, last behavioral - 30 min). They are very responsive and move pretty quickly. Easily one of the, if not the smoothest, enjoyable, and freindly interview processes I've had (but I've only done 10 so far).
