Got a offer from Company A , dropped my resignation and then got another offer in last month of notice period from different company B in different location (was not interested to relocate) but just that compensation offered is bit more. So try to talk to HR of company A if they can match up the same, which they suggested slight increase on current but cannot match, just asked again for middle number which they said no, then told to close the things on whatever slight increase they can offer and on which got the reply that they are revoking my offer as they found another candidate which is more suitable for role in my last week of notice period.
In this want to know is this my fault I try to negotiate ?
Is negotiation a crime ?
Can offer be revoke if you negotiate ?
If thats case company can also layoff if try ask for hike ?
