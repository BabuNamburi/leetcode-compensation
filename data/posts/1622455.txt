I was confident in all my interview rounds, particularly in System Design rounds. Luckily, I was not asked anything on DP and Graphs. Instead they more focused on LC medium level LinkedList, Trees and Tries questions. My projects helped me a lot in backing my answers to Leadership Principles questions. I hope this would help somebody out there.
