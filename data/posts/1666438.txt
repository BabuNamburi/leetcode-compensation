I completed my B.Tech from India and then MS in CS from USA. I worked in the USA for 5 years as a Software Developer. Because of Covid I moved back to India.
Can you please suggest what would be my desired salary range in India? I am looking for jobs as Data Engineer. Also, there's a gap of 1 year of unemployment as I have not been able to find a job here. Thank you!
