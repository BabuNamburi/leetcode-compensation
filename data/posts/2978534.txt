American Express offers internship positions in its Gurgaon and Bangalore offices in India.
The compensation for interns is 70K per month, but in 2022 they increased it to 85K per month due to the virtual nature of the internship.
The work experience is highly dependent on the team. Though I was selected for a technical role my work entailed management of teams involved in product development and deployment making the experience sub-par.
