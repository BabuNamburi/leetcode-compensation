I have recieved the offer without any discussion from the HR. I mailed them politely for the negotiation discussion but didn't got any reply from their side. I am currently not having any other offer in hand and still interviewing.
Requesting the LC community to please help me as I am confused here if I should mail them for the acceptance of the offer they have given me or to wait some more time for their reply.
