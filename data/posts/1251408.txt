I have around 6 years of experience in Backend technologies - Java.
Currently in Mumbai. And want to remain in Mumbai.
I wanted to switch - how much CTC I should expect?
Currently it's around 30 LPA.
How much Zeta/Hotstar/BookMyShow pays for that much years of experience?
Also if you aware of any good startup/poduct based companies in Mumbai, please comment it.
