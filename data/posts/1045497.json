How do you preprocess your data - cleaning, dealing with outliers...?\nii. How do you determine what model to go with? Based on the task on hand...regression. classification...\niii. What metrics are you using? Is it accuracy only or are you considering others? Other metrics include precision, recall, F1...\niv. Handling imbalance in the dataset.\nv. How do you determine if your approach is good enough? For instance, you want to deploy a model and want to determine if the new model is better than your previous model? - A/B testing (hypothesis testing.)..using tests of significance, such as the t-test and comparing it with your alpha threshhold.\nv.
