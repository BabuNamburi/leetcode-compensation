Other details:
I think the base is alright but the rest sounds low. I didn't graduate from Ivy league. However, I think I did great at onsite interview.
I am suspecting that the external hiring company forgot about me for a bit and they might already have some other people accept their offers for the same position. This makes me a bit uncomfortable about counter offering.
I do not have any other offers to negotiate with. What should I do? I wanted to commit to msft for a long time but now I am conflicted.
Edit: About being forgotten, they told me that I got accepted 2 days after the interview but they only continued the process after I e-mailed them back about how I haven't heard back. I got the offer two and a half weeks after the interview
I'm considering negotiating for 120k base, 120k stock and 30k sign bonus.
