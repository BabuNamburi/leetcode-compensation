So a company that I am in offer stages with says they won't give out a verbal offer, and will only roll out the offer once documents are submitted. That, and the fact that they won't be open to revising the offer once given out. Seems a rather unfreindly policy to me as I don't know if they'll match my expectations (they did not disclose theirs). I worked abroad previously and want to know if it even makes sense to share this information if they won't match the numbers. I don't expect them to, but locking the candidate in to the first number seems rather silly. Any thoughts on this? How have you faced it in your companies?
