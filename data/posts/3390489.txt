I joined SRIB in nov last year with below compensation:
base: 18 lpa
joining bonus: 5 lakh
other bonus: 3 lakhs
perf bonus: 2 lakhs
I have a total of 2 years of exp. I am not finding the work very useful here.also I want to switch to the full stack/ backend domain as I have good intrest in distributed systems and database.
how should i approach this situation. The work at SRIB is completely different from my intrest and i am not liking this job at all.
Please suggest what should i do.
