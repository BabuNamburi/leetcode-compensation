I have been selected for walmart sde3 role.
I have an Offer of 24L all fixed from Publicis Sapient,** How much should I ask walmart**(I am an Immediate Joiner).
Will they agree for base pay at least 24L considering my current TC is very low.
Also since 1 week HR is telling one aproval is remaining before they discuss salary.I gave Interview on 2nd december.
First they said they will release offer by Tueday and today its 9th december Thursday.
Publicis has agreed to wait till 13th since my Joining was on 6th there.
How much time does walmart take to release offer?
Feels like walmart is trying to keep me as backup resource?
What should I do? Need Help.
