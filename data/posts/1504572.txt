Competing Offers
ServiceNow - SSE
Atlassian - P4
The initial offer made by PayPal was way less than this (~39 L as compared to ~55 L). PayPal made the initial offer which I accepted and put down my notice in the current company.
I then gave a bunch of interviews and thankfully got 2 more offers within my 30 day notice.
The best way to assess your true value in the market is to get competing offers. I tell you the game completely changes. :)
I was told by HR that this is the highest that PayPal could go for this level.
