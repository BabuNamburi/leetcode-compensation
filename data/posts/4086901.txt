I recently went through an experience that left me feeling quite disheartened. Zscaler conducted a hiring drive at numerous colleges, and it was disheartening to see that not a single person was recruited from so many of these institutions. It's disappointing because I was hopeful that this could lead to a great opportunity, and it's tough to see so many talented individuals missing out. The job search process can be quite challenging, and this situation was a tough pill to swallow.
hope the situation get better soon.
