I did not get mulitple offers so I accepted this offer.
I have been interviewing for past 1 year and many times got rejected in rounds and few times cleared the rounds but position got closed.
Got a chance to interview with companies like Google, Amazon, Twilio and some other startups and mid sized companies from EU and India but could not make it.
Interview Journey highlights:
Amazon:
OA (June 2022) - Failed (I was not prepared)
Grinded for LC based problem during July 2022 - Sept 2022

Others
I have applied to many companies in India but most of the time resume got rejected and sometimes could not clear the first round.
Total Applications: 80-100 (for last 1 year)
My observations about recent interviews.
Market is really bad, make your resume stand out otherwise your resume will get rejected like me.
Many companies started asking leetcode since number of applications are increased I guess.
You will need lot of patience as many times position gets cancelled or someone out there cleared rounds before you did.
Keep trying, there is no magic here. hard work + luck.
Wish you all the best!
Thanks for reading.
