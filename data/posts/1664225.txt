I am switcing because I don't like the quality of work.
I am still in the processes of making my decision. I will not reveal their names right now because I have yet to accept the offer.
Upcoming interview: Google, Linkedin and Zeta
I will be giving Google and Linkedin just for experience as I want to work in a startup especially at the early stages of my career unless they make an offer that I can't refuse.
