Avoid JSW One Platforms Limited at all costs. The company exhibits an abysmal work culture, a toxic environment, and exceptionally poor management. The non-technical CTO Anish Nair, along with ineffective manager Kuldeep Singh and AVP Akrant Rao, contribute to a negative work experience. Together they make it a very unethical, biased and toxic workplace. Despite their deceptive pleasant talk, they exploit employees' efforts, pushing them to work tirelessly while quietly erasing their variable pay and subjecting them to Performance Improvement Plans (PI) without prior discussion or indication, even for those with exceptional performance. This unexpected action comes as a complete shock.
If presented with an offer from this company, consider accepting it while actively pursuing opportunities elsewhere. For individuals in the tech field, this establishment is far from an ideal workplace.
