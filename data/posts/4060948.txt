So I had applied to Role at Google Internship for 2024 Summers, offcampus thru career portal with referral.
I was considered for the role and got a meeting link for meet with a Google HR.
The HR (Sayali gajbe, her linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayali-gajbe-96214917/). (Bug her for roles at google if you wish)
The meeting was regarding all my information and checking if I was eligibile to apply, asked me for my college documents etc, eventually told me about further rounds of interview.
I agreed and started last minute prep for interviews, but ended up waiting a week with no communication. I mailed them over and over but no response, finally gave up as I'm still ghosted by them.
Don't know if this is common, but feels so unprofesional from this HR, I understand one may get rejected, but this should be atleast communicated, not ghosted like this.
Utterly disappointing experience, wasting people's time.
