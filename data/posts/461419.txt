Other details:
I think I have been low balled (same as many with Microsoft). I am gonna def negotiate.
First of all L59 is not cool. I am gonna push for L61 hard. Worst case will settle for L60.
Also will push for both stocks( > 125$) and base ( ~125$ or up).
Any tips / comments on the package. I am very sure there's a lot of scope for negotiation in this offer.
P.S. : If you are also negotiating or have negotiated recently let me know. We can sync up.
