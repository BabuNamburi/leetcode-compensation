I have worked as java developer earlier and this offer is for salesforce.currently i am not working from last 10 months.I will be trained on salesforce adn will have to work on salesforce moving forward.
I have prepared a lot on ds and algo but did not get any opportunity to show my skills.Now i feel like i have wasted a lot of time for investing on that.
can any one suggest me if it is a good idea to move to salesforce.Will I be able to get opportunities from companies like Microsoft,uber,amazon or any top companies as SDE in future.
I am good at DS and Algorithms but not good at system design related topics.
Any suggestions would be helpful for my career.
