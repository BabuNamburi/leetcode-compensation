Hi Everyone,
Lots of candidates are fascicated towards Browserstack Compensation and Permanent WFH Policy But they should know some real insight of the company.
My intention is not to disparage Browserstack, but rather to provide an accurate portrayal of the company and its employees.
Let's see some Pros âœ…
No Doubt, All the members of software developers are amazing and really helpful.
In your role, you'll be exposed to a diverse range of technologies and various programming languages, which will provide you with a valuable opportunity to expand your skillset.
Working with Browserstack will provide you with a valuable opportunity to gain experience in managing a startup, leading teams, and overseeing the software development processes.
Let's see cons ðŸ˜ˆ
You are going to forget about what's a good work life balance because there no such concept in reality but surely a good WLB is present only on papers or offer Letters.
They will treat you like a nothing. you are only resources for them. They will going to utilise you until you are going to say - "there's too much of Task in the plate"
The company often uses the term "responsibility" as an excuse to assign multiple tasks with tight deadlines. Even if you work hard from morning till late at night, there's always a possibility of some tasks being left unfinished. In such cases, the company will view you as an irresponsible person, regardless of the effort you put in.
The company did not explicitly declare that they were laying off employees. Instead, they are using a program called "PEP" (Performance Enhancement Plan) to justify the termination of many software developers who have received low performance ratings.
The most concerning aspect of their system is that they did not offer any severance package to the affected employees. Furthermore, they even took back the work-from-home reimbursement amount from some employees, and if an employee mistakenly asked for the money back, the company ignored their requests and stopped communicating with them altogether. It appears that the company does not value these employees anymore.
There Feedback system is worst than you think. you will Laugh at some point is this Really a point to discuss. In short if they decided to give you a poor Rating then No body can stop them
The company's main focus seems to be taking advantage of the fact that their employees are working from home permanently. According to them, since employees are at home, they have no other distractions or commitments, so they try to push for maximum output under the mask of responsibility and quarterly ratings.
The company does not believe in rewarding or showing appreciation for minor accomplishments or tasks, unless you have created an extraordinary system or exceeded their expectations in some way.
The ideology they used was Use and Throw
There's no need to be afraid of the current market situation. While it's true that there's a recession happening, it's also a fact that there are many job openings available. Preparing for interviews is a very different game than working for an organization. Those who have appeared for interviews must be knowing about it. Believe me, if you start interviewing for multiple job openings, you will gain a lot of valuable experience throughout the process. Have confidence in yourself, even in the current situation, and you will surely find a job placement soon.
This whole experience was so bad for me and lots of my friends and I wanted to share this with the community so that they decide well before joining any company.
Thank you for reading this long piece of text.
