Currently I am working at Adobe and have 7 years of experience. I have offers from zeta and microsoft with almost same pay.
The profiles for both are as follows:
Microsoft - SE (L62)
Zeta - Senior SDET
My previous roles have been related to QA and I have experience in this field. But, now want to switch to development roles. According to me, MS has a common department for dev and QA while Zeta has separate roles.
So, which would be a better choice in terms of WLB, Culture and Growth in terms of hikes and promotions? The team offered to me at MS is new and is being formed in Noida while the location for Zeta is Bangalore.
