Other details: If you're reading this, ask for 350k. I gave a "range" that started at 300, and I got very close to 300. I'm super, super happy about 305 (coming from 190), but I feel like just asking for 350 could have gotten me at least 325, if not 350. I thought 300 was the cap, but I don't think that's true.
