Google :
They were giving me Application Engineer L3 position with a very low compensation so I have rejected the offer staight away asked to take additional interviews if required for SDE position. Havent gotten any reply since then.
Microsoft:
I asked for L62 as per my experience but they are saying L61 given via interview perfomance. Will share interview experience once all the other company's interviews are done.
Current Salary : 25L (no Bonus or any Stock component, as pandemic hit i lost my job @ startup and I was jobless for couple of months then I joined Citrix)
I am planning to Join Microsoft.
