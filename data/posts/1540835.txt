HI Guys Need some suggestion.
Got offer from Walmart and Oracle.
Years of Experience : 10 years
Current CTC : 28L(24 Fixed)
Company : Walmart
Title : Senior Software Engineer
Signing Bonus: 0
Relocation : 0
CTC : 50 L (33 Fixed + 8.5 Var + 8.5 RSU)
Company : Oracle
Title : Principal Member of Technical Staff
Signing Bonus: 0
Relocation : 0
CTC : 42 L (All Fixed)
Even though CTC is high in Walmart, I am a little inclined towards Oracle due to title and fixed component salary.
Please suggest.
Update -
Walmart updated my offer now and the New CTC seems to be 61 LPA now.
39 Fixed + 2 JB + Performace Bonus (Fixed) 10 + 10 RSU = 61 LPA.
So considering walmart offer now.
