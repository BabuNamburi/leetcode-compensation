I have been offered a role in ABB.
Current Designation: Software Engineer 1
Role Offered: Fullstack Developer 1 (Data science Department)
CCTC: 9.5 LPA
CTC offered: 17 LPA
The HR said the most he can do is 17 LPA CTC, out of which around 12.5% would be the bonus.
Is this the average CTC for a person with 1 year of experience at ABB?
Couldn't find much data on internet about compensations offered at ABB.
And how is the work and work life balance at ABB?
