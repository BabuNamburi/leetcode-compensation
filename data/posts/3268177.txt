Folks, I would appreciate if you help me choose which one should i join among these?
I am personally inclined towards Acko.
Note: Adidas recruiter agreed to match the JPMC offer :) but i declined that,
right now have to choose between Acko and JPMC.Also declined TIger Analytics as it was service based company but one thing was good it has remote access.
