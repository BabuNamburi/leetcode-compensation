Hi Everyone
I have cracked the QA Automation engineer role at BCG.
I have 3 years of work experience and my current CTC is 12LPA (10 BASE)
I wanted to know how much hike can I ask from BCG.
Thinking of asking 16 Base, am I lowballing or asking too much?
Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Thank you
