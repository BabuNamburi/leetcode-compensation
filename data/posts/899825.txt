Other details: It's an early stage startup with head quarter in Silicon Valley and Tech Office in Chennai. Pay for FTE is good, 71 CTC : 26L Base + 45L (Bonuses + ESOP), Work is in the field of Data Engineering (Kafka, pipelinig, ETL etc). They also have a Data Science profile.. you can also apply for it, the pay is same for the DS profile too.
Cofounder told that there is no cap on salary increment. within an year you can ask for multiple increment evaluations and can easily cross 30L base by the end of one year. But they are looking for self-driven people who need not be given deadlines, before finalizing the offer they talked to my GSoC mentor and college professor (after 3 interview rounds) because they focus a lot on self-driven aspect of the student.
Interns get to select a project from a pool of projects and same is for the FTE employees.
