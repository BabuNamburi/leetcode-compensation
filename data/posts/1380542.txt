Exp : 3 yrs
I recently got offer from paypal India, Below are the compensation details:
Base 19L including company epf contribution
2.5L performance bonus + gratuity + meal benefit
18K USD Shares vested for 3 years
Current Pay:
14L fixed base pay
1.76L performance bonus + employer epf
I feel like this is low ball pay. Can someone suggest me is it a good package according to paypal pay scale?
NOTE: I don't have any counter offers.
