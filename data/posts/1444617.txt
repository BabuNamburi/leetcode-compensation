Experience: 3.5 years
Prev TC: 15.5 Base + 1 JB
Oracle TC: 26 Base (No JB, No stocks)
Is this a lowball, I do have competing offer in hand(around 30, but don't want to go with them for better WLB with Oracle), but Oracle has finished negotiations with me, so not sure if I have any chances of renegotiating.
