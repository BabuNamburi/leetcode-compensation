The interview questions were framed like a real world problems and not the way we see in leetcode, so there is some effort required to correctly map it to a real leetcode problem but after that it was a breez. The interviewers were nice and helpful.
I would suggest practicing LP questions out loud in front of a mirror or with friends.
