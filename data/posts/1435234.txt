I am a Final Year student currently residing in India. I have a mild disabilty in my right hand fingers which can be guaged only if one observes closely. I would not require any special accomodation from the company.
My question is whether should I disclose my disabilty on my resume in the form of 'PwD category rank' or tell it in the interview to the interviewers?
Is it beneficial to disclose it or would I face discrimination?
Please reply if you have even slight idea about these things.
