Other details: Really disappointed after hearing this number.
Rejected it next day and told them thanks for wasting my 3-4 months and lowballing at end. If they don't have budget then why they even hire people.
Full interview loop wasted my 3-4 months. Now I done with applying in mnc, planning to apply in startup only.
