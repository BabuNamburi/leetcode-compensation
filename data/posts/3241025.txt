Hi,
It will be really kind if the experinced people over here can help a fellow:
I wanted to ask how to judge a company based of their tech product.
I am looking for the job and as usual get calls from 3rd part recruiters, reaching out for a probable job opportunity but I dont understand how to weigh those new age startups/company based on their tech stack and/or Product.
I often read in comments that Company A is better than Company B because their product and technology is better. WFB and perks info can go up or down & can be read upon from various sources like glassdoor, ambitionBox, etc. but where to get the other info.
Is there any website for such info? Also, you can share any tips/tricks for getting hired.
Feel free to share the your thoughts.
Please help.
