Confused about which one to go with, considering wlb, work culture, learning as well as job security in the current market situation.
In Salesforce its for Industries cloud which i have heard a lot of negative reviews about on Blind about WLB, hectic work culture and legacy tech stack.
Publicis Sapient can offer remote but not sure about work life balance and job security there.
Blue Yonder compensation seems low. is there any scope to ask more, can someone from Blue yonder confirm please?
Reaching out to leetcode community to help me in deciding which one to choose.
