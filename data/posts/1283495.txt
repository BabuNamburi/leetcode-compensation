This seems like a lowball to me as per my expectations, Can anyone help me to confirm if someone has joined recently as a SDE 2 and what have you been offered? I was expecting the base to be atleast 22+ L.
Also, would you suggest to join Walmart (Bangalore) over Paypal if they offer slightly more than Paypal? I don't have the numbers yet but let's say INR 2-3L more. You can also give feedback regarding work and culture.
Thanks!
