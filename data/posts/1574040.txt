Other details:
I have neved had a better introductory HR call other than Zupee. The guy started out with what the company is and what will I experience if I plan to join them.
Among all the HR that directly ask for current CTC and dumb info which is already present in resume, this guy stood out, he took out time to respresent this company and worth listening. Funnt though, I felt valuable as a candidate for the first time.
Also, I had 3 months of notice period, but still they offered me the job after I cleared all the rounds. I decided to put papers only once I had offer letter in my hand and Zupee did showed faith in me, but unfortunately I got offer from a much more reputed org in last month and had to skip this opportunity.
Overall, A very good experience communicating with them. Would recommed applying there.
