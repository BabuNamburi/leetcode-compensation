Fidelity only hires freshers/graduates for SDE and DE roles through colleges, where it's a 3/6 month internship and later a PPO process. Once you join as a Full-Time-Employee you will go through their Leap Program for 3 months, training you in Full Stack Technologies. After which you join your Business Unit and the squad as an Executive Graduate Trainee (EGT) then after a few more months when the probation is over you become a normal Associate Software Engineer. From the time you joined as an FTE, 1 year later you are promoted to a Software Engineer (Grade 3 to Grade 4) where your % increase is fixed for all new hires, and not dependent on your performance.
Fidelity provides yearly hikes which range from 5-20%, based on performance and you will be given a rating out of 3 ratings, where SP means Successful Performance and EP Exceptional Performance. I will have seen most people getting an SP with a 10-12% increase. Only 5% of people in your broader squad will get an EP with more than a 15% yearly hike.
Fidelity has kept their pay the same for the past 4 years, from the 2019-2023 batch, 12 LPA with a 10 BASE, which is not all at par with other financial firms. They give you a default promotion in 1st year of service even if you work crazy hard and a default yearly hike. People don't get promoted from Software Engineer to Lead Software Engineer even after 4 years sometimes and the hike is also not at par.
Overall Fidelity is a very good employee friendly company to work in, but the pay and career progression is not good at all. Keep on trying for better.
Best of luck in your better job search, may the force be with you !
