Best part time job for students because they don't give so much workload and you can earn your pocket money. Sometimes I wrap up my work in 10 mins too. :D I applied through there website, there are only 2- 3 TAs for each course they offer and responsibilities are solving students doubt in written format.
Sorry I have to ask, Give me thumbs up if this helps.
