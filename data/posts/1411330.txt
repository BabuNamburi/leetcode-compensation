Hi All,
I have recently got an offer from Coinbase for IC4. The salary is a pretty good hike from my current TC.
How would joining Coinbase India be like as a pilot batch considering they are starting the operations in India.
Also, please share if you know about the WLB, career growth, learning curve, promotion frequency, onsite opportunities(?) etc.
YOE - 3 years
Thanks
