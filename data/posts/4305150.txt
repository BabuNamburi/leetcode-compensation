First compensation proposed was 32L and 65K USD. I tried to negotiate with recruiter citing ongoing interviews at remote AI Companies. Recruiter came back 2 days later with a new number given above
I appeared for around 6 interviews (2 was lean hire, so had to appear 2 extra coding interviews)
PS: Was Intially downleveled to SDE1 but got some push for SDE-2 from hiring manager. Took a total of 2 months in total (inclusive of team matching) to get my offer
I will add interview experience later in sometime.
