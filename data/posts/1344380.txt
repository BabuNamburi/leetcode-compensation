Also had competitive offers from Startups and Product Based Company.
They were pretty reluctant in giving hike more than 40% initially, but later they agreed when i told i already have competitive offers in hand. Got the offer letter but didnt join as i had better one in hand from product based.
But McKinsey being a big brand, i was initially bit confused if i should really let go of this chance. But i decided based on the domain of the company that it is consulting after all and i have more inclination towards product based. I hope i made the right decision.
