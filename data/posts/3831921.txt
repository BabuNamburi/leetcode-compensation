Hi All,
I am in discussion with few companies about the offer for SDE 2 role (Tesco, Groww, EPAM).
Tesco was offering 40 fixed and 2 bouns.
Groww I asked them for 40 fixed and then other things, they refused to even 38 fixed and they were offering very less esops so I rejected, exact number were not discussed.
EPAM - They were giving me 40 fixed for Bangalore location and 35-36 for Gurgaon location, apart from that some bonus that I don't remember.
All were offering relocation as usual based on their policy.
Anyone can please suggest which company I should join, I am looking for good scalable work with WLB.
Trying to avoid startups (but can consider if its profitable and has good work culture).
Need your help to choose the right companies, I will be greatful.
