For Non- IT People: In 2016, I completed my degree and worked as Tractor Service Engineer for 1.2 LPA for 6 months, Moved to TCS in same year DEC (placed via off Campus). Pay was around 3.3L. Worked 2.4 yrs there and moved to another product company for 7LPA(4.2 to 7). I worked around 1.10 yrs and moved to another ERP company for 17LPA. (7.5 to 17). Now from 17 to 51LPA. No time is bad for switching unless we try. From 1.2LPA to 51LPA I feel more motivated now.
