I am from a tier 1 college, I got a full time offer from both Nvidia and Oracle(as a fresher, zero years of experience), which company should I join. Any suggestions? Along with some supporting points. Thanks!
CTC Nvidia=25 (base 14.75, stocks=16 lakhs for 4 years (25% per year))
CTC Oracle=31 (base ~16, stocks~10 lakhs per year)
