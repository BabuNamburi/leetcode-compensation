Hey fellow leetcoders,
I have two offers:-
Microsoft L63:- 72 LPA (44 base +20 rsu + 8 bonus)
Atlassian P5:- 84 LPA (54 base + 20 rsu + 10 bonus)
YoE:- 9
Ignoring the difference in compensation
Which org would you suggest given the work quality, security, culture etc. ? Please tell with a valid reasoning
