I am currently working at a MNC with fixed comp at around 21L and 2L perf Bonus. I have an offer from Goldman Sachs for Associate Position with a fixed comp of 27-28 L and performance bonus of around 4L with no joining bonus. I have a 3 YoE . Should I consider accepting this offer given the market condition and my current job is highly secure and this offer is low ball I guess. I asked somwhere around 35L fixed comp but they didn't consider. I will also have to move to diff city.
Please help me guys.
