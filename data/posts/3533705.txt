Hi,
I just wanted to ask what is being considered a good salary for the below profile.
Job Title - Senior Software Engineer
My present CTC - 25 lacs per annum (all fix)
Official work - Mix of Data Engineer and SDE (3:1 i.e 75% work belongs to data engineer role and rest 25% belongs to backend engineering task)
Work Location - NCR
Company Type - (Good) Product based
Stocks - 0
Other Component (like variable pay, performance pay etc) - 0
My questions are:
What should be a good package for 5 year experience personal working as a SSE in Big Data?
Considering the present scenario is it okay to switch to some new age start up (they are paying upto 40lacs as a Base pay per annum )?
In case i want to switch to MAAGM/Good Product based MNC's companies what should my ideal and average package would be as per You?
Thanks you for giving your time.
