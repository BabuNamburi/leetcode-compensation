Hi All @Leetcode
I am above average software developer working in Bangalore with CTC of 22 LPA and having 8 years of experience.
Is this salary average for this experience and what all can be expected from the tier-1/tier-2 companies for this experience.
I am currently working in C++/Java development and thinking to make a company switch;how long does it takes for the preparation and does it worth the switch as work and culture is my current company is more or less good.
Also since my experience is already 8 years;should i start giving interviews on regular basis,as I have heard that no of job switch opportunities reduces drastically after 10-12 years of experience.
Anyone please help and suggest on the same
Thanks.
