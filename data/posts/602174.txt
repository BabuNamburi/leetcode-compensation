Facebook, Amazon, and Google all made offers. My negotiation "strategy" was to be very open and honest with all recruiters, keeping them informed about what everyone else was saying.
Google's initial offer was $272850/year over four years.
Facebook's initial offer beat Google's, so Google made the counteroffer above to beat FB by about 5%.
Apparently beating competitors' offers by 5-10% is standard practice at Google.
