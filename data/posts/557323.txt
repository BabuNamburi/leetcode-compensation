Edit for anyone who feels they're not good enough:
This journey was in no way easy, and lots of times I spent sleepless nights LeetCoding to make sure I wouldn't screw up an interview (which I failed MULTIPLE). And even in school, learning CS for the first time my sophomore year didn't come to me easy and I struggled-and failed-a LOT (all the interviews I failed and positions I was rejected for told me more than I needed to know). Oh, and it didn't help being a girl and person of color where you don't really see people that look like you and often get discouraged. But I promise you it's worth it! LeetCode every day and I promise you'll land something! :)
