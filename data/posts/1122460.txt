I have worked primarily in service\consulting. I was fed up with consulting and want to get into product based company like Google\Facebook. To all my friends who are in similar situation (more than 15 years of experience in service industry) do not loose hope and keep on trying. It was my second attempt with FAANG and I made it and you can too. My first attempt was with AMZN in September-2020 and I could not make it. There was a time I felt low and thought of quiting prepartion:(. Keep on trying and you will get into FAANG (or whatever company you would like to get into).
I tried to negotiate it but recruiter did not budge as I do not have competing offer.
Good luck to all of you. Thanks for reading it.
