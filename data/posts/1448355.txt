I feel I am seriously lowballed I do not know why? :( . What do you guys feel? I was not looking for a job right now, just because it was MS, I opted for an interview and I am north Indian guy based in Chennai and want to relocate to bangalore. They said they will relocate me. I tried to negotiate they did not budge.
Thanks.
