Need help Regarding which company to join.
Afraid to join amazon because of pip culture
and poor WLB.
I have given interview for alexa experience team . if anyone has some insight into the team. Please do share.
The Base for amazon is highest i have ever seen for my experience.
Regarding SuprDaily, i am worried about uncertainty and job security in such a small startup. (25 engineers ryt now in team).
Stocks of swiggy might be worth lot more when it goes to IPO.
Hence i have choice to make between a company with 30 employees vs 5 lakh employees
Please give your unbiased comments regarding what could be the best option for me
