Other details:
Objects Round (60 Minutes):
First part of my IBM interview was about coding and stuff. They gave me two coding questions to solve. Not too hard, just basic DSA stuff. They told me I had 60 minutes to finish them. It was a bit of a race against the clock, but I did my best.
Tech Questions Round:
Next, they started throwing tech questions at me. They really wanted to know how much I knew about tech stuff. It was kinda tough, but I tried my best to answer. They also gave me another coding challenge. This one was trickier than the first one. This round took like 45 minutes to an hour.
HR Round (Chat About Job and Offer):
After all that, we had a chat about the job they wanted to offer me. IBM's HR team talked money, benefits, and all those job things. I asked a bunch of questions about the job just to make sure I got it. Then I said, "Yeah, I want the job!"
NOTE
Mention one project in your resume otherwise you will get rejected in this round even without an interview.
Familiarise yourself with the core subjects.
Try some coding contests for practice.
Don't feel bad if coding isn't easy for you.
If you're stuck for a long time, don't be shy.
Donâ€™t make a pre-mindset.
Keep Cool.
