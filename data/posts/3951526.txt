NEED ADVICE ( Flutter Developer )
Hii Leetcoder's ,
I'm a fresher ,I recently started working at a startup as a FLUTTER DEVELOPER ,I'm curious about the FUTURE of a CAREER IN FLUTTER , Are there many companies that use Flutter? Is Flutter still in high demand?
I'm also wondering if there are plenty of job opportunities in Flutter, or if I should start learning other frameworks too. Any advice you could provide would be really helpful.
Will my Experience in Flutter help to land a job with good package .
If anyone have any idea , please respond !
Thankyou !
