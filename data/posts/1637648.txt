I am not sure if this is a good or bad offer. I read some reviews on Glassdoor saying that razorpay doesn't give good increments so we should try to get good numbers while joining itself. Any idea about the work culture, work quality, etc on razorpay. Any points would be helpfull. Priority - Work Quality > WLB > Good Appraisals.
