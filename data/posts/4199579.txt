So I got offers from Twilio and Avalara and I cannot decide which to join, joining date is within a week,
Education : B.tech from Tier 3
Exp : 3 yrs in service based MNC(not WITCH).
Current CTC: ~15 LPA
Twilio L2:
24 L (Base) + 8 L (RSU vested quarterly) ~ 32 L
Tech stack -> Java
Avalara SSE:
31.5 L (Base) + 2 L (Joining Bonus) + 3 L (Variable) ~ 35 L for first year
Tech stack -> Golang
Any suggestion which one to join? in terms of growth, work culture, domain of work offered etc.
I am still leaned towards more on Twilio because of tech sack and brand value.
