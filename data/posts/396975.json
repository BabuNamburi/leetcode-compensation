You need to be able to write beat 90% solution in less than 20 minutes. Just keep reviewing these 3 problem sets, only 150-ish problems total, not need to eager on new problems.\n8 YOE totaly, 6 years in a small company, 2 years in a medium size company.\nbase 155,000\nsign on 79,000 + 60,000\nstock 89\non avg about 230k TC\nMicrosoft\nOnphone + Onsite\nOnsite has 4 rounds, 45 minutes each.\nOnly 190k TC, forgot the detail numbers.
