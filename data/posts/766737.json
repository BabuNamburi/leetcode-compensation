Here are my tips:\nDon't agree with any number of negotiation at the first place. Allow both sides to think and discuss.\nRespect the recruiter, you can imagine to get an agreement is like a win-win solution; so do not brag your expectation too high.\nTry to get a competing offer from any other company. It signals that you have another option to walk away from the deal.\nNegotiate for each component by the following order: Base Salary > Stock > Signed-on bonus > Relocation package."}
