My TC at my current/prior role is 40 LPA. (Base Pay - 32 LPA)
I had 4 technical rounds of interviews wherein a couple of them were focussed on DSA and Problem Solving, while the remaining two were design oriented. (one each for LLD and HLD respectively). The questions asked in the DSA rounds were a mixture of Leetcode medium and hard levels. I intend to cover more on this in a separate post.
I come from a non-IIT Tier-1 institute.
