I have around 12 years of hw and sw experience and I live in HCOL.
I got positive feedback from the MSFT HR about my onsite.
We had a good discussion about my expectations and reality. She told me that my expectations are a bit higher, and that my expected salary falls in the Sr engineer range. The MSFT offer will be 20-25K lower than my expectation.
MSFT offer will not bring any increase to my current salary.
I was honest with HR and explained, I dont want to be in the job market in 2-3 years unhappy with salary. I did express my desire and interest in the team and work for MSFT for a long period.
I am waiting on HR to get back to me. They are gonna discuss it with the compensation committee.
I am not sure how I should play this out. I dont have a competing offer.
Any help/ guidance will be appreciated.
