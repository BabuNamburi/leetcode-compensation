Hello Everyone,
I wanted a help in deciding between the offers I have.
Please share your inputs.
YOE - 3.9 years
Current Pos - Senior QA Engineer in Top Product Based company
Current CTC - 16 LPA
Offer 1
Adobe:
Software Quality Engineer 2 (SQE 2)
Base - 15.2/year
Stock - 9.3L/ year (Every year till 4 years)
Variable Pay - 1.5 L/Year (though they mention 10 % I will taking it as 5%
so 70 k /year)
JB - 3 Lakh in 1st Year and 2 Lakh in 2nd Year
Other standard Adobe benefits..
Total CTC -> 15.2 + 70 k + 3 + 9.4 = 28.2/ year
Offer 2
AJIO
SDET 2
Base - 23L
Performance - Though they say 10% I'll take it as 5% = ~1.3L
Bonus - 2L
Total - 23 + 1.3 + 2 = 26.3 L/year
Both offer are almost same But the major diff is that ADOBE base CTC (15.2 LPA) is lesser than my current CTC (16 LPA) means less inhand salary and also In Adobe after 4 years of period No stock grant means again i will be having only my base CTC,
but in AJIO whatever I am getting base CTC in future also i will get on the top of that.
And also if i joins Adobe and trhen i switches from Adobe after 2-3 years then at that time again i have to find the company which gives ctc in stocks else i will be not get complete hike on my base + stcoks, only company will give me the hike on base part and will try to compensate my stcoks in from of JB and other benifits.
Community please guide me on this.
