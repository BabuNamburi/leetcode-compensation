PS. Need genuine advice guys. This is my 3rd company (Tenure: 3y 5m in 1st, 2.5m in 2nd, >2m in Current). I switched 1st company due to less salary. Switched second due to no project for 2 months. But now also its been more than 2 months and I am not getting any learning in this team. No development work is assigned in my team. Is it good to start looking outside? Will the frequent switch affect my future? If yes, when should I ideally switch this company?
