I can use some advice on choosing the right company to intern at. A little about me, I'm a 2022 grad and these offers are for a 6-month internship in the DevOps/Infrastructure teams of the above-mentioned companies. Here's the breakdown,
Meesho: 50k INR/mo (Stipend)
• New team being formed. Lots of experienced and senior people joining the team around this time.
• The work being offered is decent. They're looking to move towards using containers (read K8s) which is something I've worked on extensively during my past internships.
• ESOPs for all.
Grofers: 50k INR/mo (Stipend)
• Specialized teams in place for a long time (Cloud Platform team, CD Platform team, Kubernetes Platform, Reliability team). Possibility of being siloed out.
• If their tech blog is anything to go by, their infra team does some great work. I've no doubts about the quality of work being offered to me.
• No ESOPs to L1 employees.
SenseHQ: 50k INR/mo (Stipend)
• New company in the block. Hiring aggressively in India across all levels. Though the infra team has only two people as of now.
• The kind of work and projects that the reporting manager mentioned weren't the best.
• ESOPs for all. They're also willing to convert me earlier (in 3 months) rather than waiting for 6 months. Series D US-based startup.
If you're still reading, then please read ahead about my aspirations and desired career path. I'm very motivated to work in the areas of distributed systems and cloud-native computing (think Golang, K8s, and all the other open-source deep infra tools). Starting out in DevOps may not be the best idea but this is what I've been able to crack as of now and I also think working in Infra/Platform teams gives one a good idea in case they end up developing the tooling going forward. My next goal would be to either transition into a role in the Platform team or shift to a company that works on open source tools (Redhat, vmware, etc.)
If you've any insights regarding choosing the offer or about my career path, please drop a comment. I'll appreciate it. If there's anything I missed, please feel free to mention and I'll update the post.
