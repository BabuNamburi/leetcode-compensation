Need suggestions on negotiation:
What should be my overall strategy for negotiation? How much can I aim for?
How much total TC can I negotiate for?
Should I negotiate for a higher base (as they gave a base 16% lower than my current base)?
Should I negotiate for a higher stock bonus? How high can I go?
Any other suggestions would be welcome.
Thanks!
