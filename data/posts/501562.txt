This is a semiconductor company that is based in the Netherlands, but the job is in the US (where I'm from). Interview process was challenging. It was mostly in C/C++. I was asked to draw the C memory map, explain my internship project in detail, write a function that checks if a string is a valid palindrome, and to draw an SR-Latch (I'm a computer engineer, hence why I was asked). I was extremely surprised with the salary as I thought it would be much much less. I'm very happy with this offer. It is mostly embedded systems programming in C.
