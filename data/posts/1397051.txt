Hey, I have received offer from Amazon fro SDE-1 for Total CTC around 34LPA and receiving offer from Arcesium for Senior Software Engineer, for around the same CTC.
What should I do? I think Arcesium is low balling the offer somewhere.
Amazon CTC:
Base: 18.5 LPA
JB: 5LPA (First year) + 3 LPA (Second year)
Relocation: 1.5LPA
RSU: 10LPA
Arcesium: in discussion
