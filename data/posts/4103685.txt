Hi community,
I have received an offer from Oracle, any suggestion or feedback is highly appreciated.
Education : Tier1 BTech
YOE : 3+ years
Previous TC : 42L
Previous Base : 25L
Base : 40L (+ 2L PF)
Joining Bonus : 10L
Stocks : $ 70K (vested equally over 4 years)
Approx TC : 65LPA (including JB and excluding annual/performance bonus)
I did not really like the area of work team is doing and the vibe I had with the managers was not really that of peers. Seemed like a student-teacher relationship due to the huge age gap.
I do have other offers from startups (Max TC from the startups are 40LPA) and ongoing interview rounds with Microsoft.
