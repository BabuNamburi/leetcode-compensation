I intend to do Masters in CS from US or directly relocate abroad as Software Engineer after 1-2 years (Just relocate for a couple of years not permanently). What seems like a good option for now?? Really confused between Amazon being FAANG + variety of services to learn like AWS and might help in Masters/applying for jobs abroad but also Flipkart is in startup phase so I think there will be lots to learn there too.
If someone's working in these companies, please help. Really appreciated!! Thanks!!
