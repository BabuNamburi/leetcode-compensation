I am a fresher and I have an offer of Associate Technical Support Engineer from Salesforce, but my interest lies in Coding and Development (rated 2300+ on lc).
I wanted to know how easy is the internal switch process at Salesforce as I am thinking of joining as an ATSE(Associate Technical Support Engineer) then do internal switch to AMTS(Associate Member of technical staff).
How frequent internal switches happens at Salesforce ? What is the process ? Or should I even join the org with this role ??
Please help!
