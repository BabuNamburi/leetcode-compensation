Hi Everyone,
I recently received offer from Salesforce for SMTS position and location is Hyderabad. I am currently based out of Noida and working here as a SDE-3 in a Vertical SaaS Sequoia backed Startup.
Salesforce Offer - 48L(Fixed)+7L(Bonus)+17L(Stocks)~=72L
Current - 42L+3L(ESOP)
Revised offer from Current company - 56L+10L(ESOP) ~= 66L
Need to decide what to do in current situation. Noida is suitable location for me as my home is nearby and my parents have health issues.
Reason for looking out was mostly about work and current market situation. Company is ready to help me with everything related to work and for market situation they are saying then can easily sustain for 2yrs from now.
Need some advice here from some experienced folks or someone who has faced similar situation from past.
