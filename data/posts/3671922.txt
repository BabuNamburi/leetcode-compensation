Respected community seniors, peers and fellow members. Writing this post to get a rough idea on what my salary structure should look like keeping in mind the details shared below. Kindly spare some time and guide me. I have started using leetcode couple of days back.
[ Recently few events had happened that has forced me to relook and enhance my salary. I am facing rejections quoting that Engineers of your age are earning 3x/4x/5x of your current. I never thought that I have to write such a post and I was content with my current salary, but i believe now my salary needs to change. Kindly Ignore the post if its Inappropriate for you and not the right place for seeking answers and advice ]
