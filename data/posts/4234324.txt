Other details: Rejected the offer since very less increment and no benefits as such. If I consider benefits at my current company, that itself will account to around 3-4LPA cash before taxes. Also if anyone is working there or joined recently would like to know review of the company. I felt like there is a lot of pressure/workload there right now.
