I had the power to negotiate because of my Amazon Offer
[OLD]I'm 95% joining Zeta(Unless Uber stuns me with some magical number) because of the following reasons:
Better WLB in terms of other offers i have (Amazon/Hotstar/Navi)
Great Projects (i personally am very bullish on Fintech) and Peers
I believe i should work a few more years before joining a company I'd like to settle down in
Its the highest Fix Salary I've been offered, a lot of companies provide huge signing bonus which are not considered while switching and are lapsed after max 2 years ( Amazon itself rejected to acknowledge my salary to be 30L because i had a Fix bonus of 2L )
