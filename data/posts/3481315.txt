Hi Everyone
I joined Digitate 8 months back and I was asked whether I am interested to join project related to Data science, I thought Data science is trending so chose the project. But now I want to switch just because the compensation is very low for me, I am not able to pay my loans etc (before joining I was going through Amazon hiring process - later it freezed). So when I started searching for jobs related to Data science there were hardly jobs for freshers either they requires 3+ yoe or Masters. And there were many jobs related to Frontend/Backend even for fresher. So I am willing to learn any tech, I asked my manager if he is okay to to put me in Frontend/Backend team also he is fine with it to put me in any Project. The project in which I am working right now is best in TCS also team & manager is also best.
So I am confused what should I do whether change the project to Frontend/Backend for quick switch or stay in Data science for better future.
Any comments/feedback will be appreciated
