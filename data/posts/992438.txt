Current Compensation : 16.2 LPA (14.2 Fixed + 1.5 Performance Bonus + Gratuity & PF)
Negotiation Details :
I negotiated for almost 1 week. Initially they offered me 24L fix + 2.4L variable. When i asked if they are open for negotiating on the numbers, he said that is the best he can offer. I asked for 2 days time to think. I got a call from him 3 days after that day. It was a long 30 min call in which i asked for 10% raise on the other offer total compensation. HR firstly refused and said straight away NO but later said he will talk with the management and would get back. I got a call again after 3 days and he disclosed the above numbers :)
I would like to thank whole leetcode community and advice everyone to keep practicing.
