I recevied an offer from Paypal 2 months back for Software Engineer-2 as I was not having any competing offer I was low balled no matter how much I tried for the negotiation.
Yesterday I have got better offer from Expedia for Software Development Engineer-2 but I still want to join Paypal. Is it possible to negotiate now with Paypal provided after 2 days is my joining date?
Please help me which is better Paypal or Expedia in terms of work culture, growth and all.
Updates: Yeah I humbly asked them if there is a room to negotiate and Paypal interestingly came back with the matching offer in a polite way, but I had to reject it because of the location and the kind of work I was getting here in Expedia.
My observation is you should always negotiate because what recruiters always offer you in the first place is the least package allocated for that particular band and they are bound to do that as they have to present the same to their leaders.
So if you have a counter offer please negotiate back no matter what the situation is and you never know what may turn out next.
Hence, go ahead since...
Failure is better than the regrets :)
