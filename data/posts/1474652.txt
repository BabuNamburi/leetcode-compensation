I have an offer from Freshworks India. At the time of the offer, the share price was mentioned as $190 per share. The shares are to be vested over four years. But as per the reports I read online today, the value of a Freshworks share is $28-$32(it's not yet listed, this is the proposed price). I don't have much knowledge in stocks, so can anybody tell me if I'm missing something here? Why is there such a huge difference between the quoted($190) and proposed price? Any information provided is deeply appreciated.
