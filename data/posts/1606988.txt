First there was a phone call asking about my past experiences and describing what I liked and disliked. I believe the goal of this is to see the level of enthusiasm you have and if you are a person to talk bad about a project you had.
Next, if they liked you they would schedule a Microsoft Teams interview with you and a HR rep, and there you're asked more situational questions in the work environment. These questions are like "If you and John Doe have a negative interaction, how would you handle XYZ situation". You are also asked basic comp science questions like what are the different types of loops, and whats the differences between them.
Finally, if the HR rep likes you, you are scheduled for another meeting where you talk to a few developers. They give you an online assessment where you finish as much problems as you can, these are codding problemes, but more like brain teasers. Your action/reaction to these are monitored an you have 40 minutes to answer them. Then you meet the developers again where you have to finish code that has been pre-built and find its previous flaws. Then you are given a brain teaser SQL question. After that, they ask you to talk to the developer , so the developer can understand what type of person you are. And I believe the developer gives the final YAY or NAY on you.
Give a thumbs up if this is helpful :) Glad to help!
