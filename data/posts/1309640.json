{"text": "Hi All,\nI have almost 9 years of experience in the industry working as QA and Automation engineer and also an infrastructure developer.\nI am in a great dilemma in choosing between two offers i have gotten.\nGoogle: L3 Test Engineer.\nCisco: QA tech lead.\nGoogle will not match Cisco's offer of course due to the difference in levels.\nAs it is my dream to work with Google I am at a cross road now. I don't know how to choose between these two offers. Is there a downside going one level down to Google from my current level or should I pick the level upgrade with Cisco offer?\nSeeking leetcode community inputs in weighing these two options. Thanks in advance for your inputs."}
