I interviewed with Flipkart for the role of SDE-1(Bangalore).
I am a B.Tech from ECE branch Tier-1 College. (2020 passout).
Previous Experience - Natwest Group (Software Engineer) (Previous Compensation -9 lac fixed)
Current Offer from Flipkart -
18lac fixed pay ( this includes both pf deductions (employer and employee))
1.8 performance bonus (This is a variable Component)
5.07 lacs worth of ESOPS vesting 25 percent per year.
Apart from this they provide 40k worth of relocation reimbursement
40k worth of (15 days hotel stay and flight tickets (one way))
12k per annum mobile reimbursement.
12k per annum broadband reimbursement.
So the total Compensation for each year becomes. = 18 + 1.8 + (5.07/4) ~ 21 lacs.
Hope this helps.
