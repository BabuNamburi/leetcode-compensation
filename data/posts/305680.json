{"text": "I have 2 yoe, here is the offer that they've told me.\nEducation: BS\nYears of Experience: 2\nPrior Experience: FactSet\nDate of the Offer: 6/4/2019\nCompany: Microsoft\nTitle/Level: 60\nLocation: Redmond, WA\nSalary: 120k\nRelocation/Signing Bonus: 10k sign, 13.5k relocation\nStock bonus: 25k/4\nBonus: upto 20%\nTotal comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): 136.250\nBenefits: insurance etc\nOther details:\nI think the base is alright but the rest sounds low. I didn't graduate from Ivy league. However, I think I did great at onsite interview.\nI am suspecting that the external hiring company forgot about me for a bit and they might already have some other people accept their offers for the same position. This makes me a bit uncomfortable about counter offering.\nI do not have any other offers to negotiate with. What should I do? I wanted to commit to msft for a long time but now I am conflicted.\nEdit: About being forgotten, they told me that I got accepted 2 days after the interview but they only continued the process after I e-mailed them back about how I haven't heard back. I got the offer two and a half weeks after the interview\nI'm considering negotiating for 120k base, 120k stock and 30k sign bonus."}
