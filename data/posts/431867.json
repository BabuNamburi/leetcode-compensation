Should I negotiate and how? I have a (higher) competing offer, but this role seems very interesting.\nInterview experience:\nInitial call with HM, after being sent a linkedin message\nsecond call with principal SA\n3rd call with both HM and principal\nPhone calls are technical discussions but not coding. Additionally you should do some research about the software Nvidia builds to make GPUs useful for many, and be prepared to talk about them and apply them to specific problems.\nOnsite: full day of interviews. Some rounds are more customer facing explanations of the role, some are regular coding questions (easy / medium LC), some are ML / NLP oriented (review your fundamentals, and be able to roughly code SGD on a simple task), and one is a presentation you give to the team on a subject you choose.\nAll interviewers were nice, and happy to discuss the cool projects they are working on."}
