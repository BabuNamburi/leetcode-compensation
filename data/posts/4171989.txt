Other details: Negotiated once. Got much better offers, but they managed to go only a little bit higher (90k -> 95k base, and a bit more stocks). Also team match lasted a few months, not many teams are hiring. Did a regular coding interview, not the SRE-specific one, 100% of questions were from Leetcode
Quite a lowball offer for my experience, so didn't accept it. Don't blame Google, my interview performance was mediocre.
