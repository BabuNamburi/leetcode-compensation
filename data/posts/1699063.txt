Guys , Advice Needed . Please help
Years of Experience: 2.4 years
Prior Experience: SE @Samsung
Currently I had joined a startup named TechMojo as Member of Technical Staff a week before
TC:
Salary - 22L
Joining Bonus - 0
Relocation - 0
Performance Bonus - 2L
Total Comp : salary + bonus + stocks = 24L
Now I have received a mail from Amazon that I am being offered L4 (SDE1) at Amazon Gurgoan.
They have not shared compensation details but even in best case fixed base will be around 18-20L.
I had been giving other FAANGM interviews and was rejected in Google and Microsoft after onsite. Facebook interviews are still going on.
My priority will be to have some quality experience, growth and some time for preparation.
What is your take on it ? Should i jump the boat to Amazon just for brand (i dont think there is going to be a base increase) ? My current startup seems nice in the terms of learning opportunities.
