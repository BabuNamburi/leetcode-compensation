Overall I'm satisfied with the TC. Recruiter said this is the max they can provide with. But not sure if I should join it. Especially because I'm not sure if my promotion will be delayed because I'm switching the company after 1 year.
Should I join Amazon? To be honest, I don't like the work at the current company. So just looking for the change.
