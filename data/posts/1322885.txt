2.5 weeks back I received verbal offer from OCI hyderabad and recently got to know that I cleared background check. But I am not getting from HR the expected date by which I will receive offer letter. Does anyone who recently bagged offer from Oracle can tell me after how much time did they got the offer letter?
Offered TC per year: 30L(base) + 6L(Stock) + 3L(JB)
