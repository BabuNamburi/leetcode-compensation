I have probably received the most lowball offer among all L4 offers I see here.
I had to double check with the recruiter if this was even an L4 offer or an L3 offer.
Very disappointed. Can someone confirm if they have also received an offer similar to this in the past?

Negotiated once with counter offers from AWS and FB. New offer TC: 288K.
