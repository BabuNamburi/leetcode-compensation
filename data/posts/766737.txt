Getting pass onsite interview is hard but I think get a reasonable offer is worthwhile. Here are my tips:
Don't agree with any number of negotiation at the first place. Allow both sides to think and discuss.
Respect the recruiter, you can imagine to get an agreement is like a win-win solution; so do not brag your expectation too high.
Try to get a competing offer from any other company. It signals that you have another option to walk away from the deal.
Negotiate for each component by the following order: Base Salary > Stock > Signed-on bonus > Relocation package.
