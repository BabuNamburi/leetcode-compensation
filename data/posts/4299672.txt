UPDATE:
I am surprised to see the comments on this post having so much negative about Cohesity, similar to Glassdoor or Blind.
Glad I didn't join it. Plus, the 2 years bond for the joining bonus and too much equity dilation are definitely red flags.
I chose another fully-remote startup over Cohesity, but guess what, it is like 2x work and lesser compensation (not considering any value of non-IPO'ed RSUs) as compared to my previous company. I don't see any value of fully remote if I can't enjoy my life, so leaving it too for an MNC with hybrid-office, higher compensation and good WLB reputation.
