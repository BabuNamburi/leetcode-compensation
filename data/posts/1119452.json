{"text": "Hi Friends,\nHope you are all doing good.\nI recently received summer 2021 internship offers from these companies(salesforce, microsoft, cisco). I would like to know which one you suggest me to go with among the 3 offers.\nHere is what they are offering:\nMicrosoft and cisco pay the same stipend but salesforce pays around $6000 more when compared to the other two. Work/Team wise, teams where I will be a part of during the internship do have good work that I like.\nI would like to know your opinion regarding the work culture, internship conversion rate(to a mid level position as I have 2 years of work experience) as I am not a big fan of brand.\nHope you will me make a right decision.\nThanks in advance!!"}
