Experience : ~ 2.5yrs
Both offering same Compensation : 24.5 LPA TC
Prev comp : 16 LPA
As both companies offer same compensation, I like to know which is better in terms of future growth. While one is startup and the other is MNC, I am slightly inclined towards citrix while considering the stability and the fact that i have a loan to pay. Like to know a little about salary hikes as well. If you recommend a company please also tell me why.
