Exp: 1.5 years in Product Based Company
Past TC: 16LPA base + 15K USD vested over 4 years + typical MNC benefits
New TC: 23LPA base, no stocks or benefits
Work at current organization is limited in scope with little to no transferable skills. Hence decided to switch whatever option came in this down market. Did I lowball myself? Considering I'd have been promoted this March end with base bumping to 20LPA.
