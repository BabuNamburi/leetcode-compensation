I am SE with 3 yr exp in industry in Product based companies.
I got layed off twice(due to cost-cutting), thus a total 3 company switches in <3 yr total.
Thus, in this time of recession and above mentioned switches, I am unable to get enough shortlistings to avl job opportunities.
I am searching for a new role from past 4+ months.
Right now, I am interviewing for a Service based company and being offered a role as a Developer to a their Client, with a 20-25% hike on my last compensation.
Given the domain knowledge, though the work will be similar in terms of technology, its always seen a low in Service based companies.
Can you please suggest if its a right to join a Service based organisation?
Will that impact my future career track?
I dont want to join it just for the sake of having a job. As being umemployed of this long makes you desperate and take anything you can get.
Please advise.
P.S. I understand this section is for sharing compensation offers, but I geniuenly need your industry insight(s)
