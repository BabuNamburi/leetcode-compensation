During a LLD design round,
What are the criterion used to judge a candiate (specifically for LLD round), like use of SOLID principle etc.
Is interviewee expected to run the code end to end or white board design is enough?(Yes/No/Depends from company to company)
If answer to the previous question is yes
then does the interviewee needs to prepare boiler plate code.
How is the input taken, CLI, files or test cases?
How realistic it is to write and run 400-500 lines of code and run it within 60-90 mins?
This thread can be used to track the list of companies which has LLD rounds. Folks who had LLD round can mention the name of the company in the comments.
