My take on the interviews -
LC premium questions for Microsoft are really good. Got the 1st one from it. Also most of the questions in other companies' interviews were also from Leetcode.
Do some mock interviews with friends it really helps and leetcode's new interview feature is quite useful!
Be prepared for simple HR questions and for the internship good grip on OOPS and implementation of basic Data Structure is needed. OS, CN, DBMS wasn't asked to anyone.
Good CPI are needed and projects in resume apart from academic ones stand out. (I have previously won 2 hackathons)
