This was revised offer after negotiation. Declined the offer as there was no significant raise in current CTC. Microsoft annual refreshers are not good (14k USD avg over 5 years). At L63, hike is 5-8% avg. My hike has never been below 13% in my current company and i am up for promotion next year. Microsoft stocks are at ATH with 10-15% over valuation in my opinion due to market surge.
