Really preferred NYC as location too but currently I work remote in the midwest and TC is great for COL. Microsoft TC isn't bad but the work seems uninspiring. Similar for the Atlantic, I first interviewed with them thinking it was the Athletic(lol) and went along with it for negotiating power. Current job is actually awesome, fully remote, I was the 2nd developer in a rebuilding team. The actual company's grown 3x since I've joined and am getting a lot of experience on work and getting 10% yearly raises. There's almost no equity which is a shame and the C suite's culture don't really match up to what I'm looking for. But with these offers, not sure if it's worth the move.\nTC: 115K"}
