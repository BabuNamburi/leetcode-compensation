Negotiations: I took my time to negotiate the compensation, because although I had a very good competing offer, I was still offered with a good but not so great an offer. I carefully heard recruiter's initial offer, and negotiated it then and there. Later, after a little increase in the offer, I still asked for more time to analyse the offer and do more research. Post that, I scheduled another call to negotiate further. I am mentioning all this just to remind everyone to:
"Never settle for less. If you know you deserve more, simply ask. Just make sure you're respectful, polite and professional when you do so."
