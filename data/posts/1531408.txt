Received a verbal offer from ZScaler for Staff role (Dev role in cloud security) -
Base: 40 LPA
Bonus: 4 LPA
RSU's: 40k/4 years
TC: 51.5 LPA
Current TC: 39LPA (35 Fixed + 4 Bonus)
YOE: 10+
Asking for a reason to give such a great hike on current is responded with a sentence -
PARITY WITH OTHER COLLEAGUES IN THE TEAM (WTF)
No other offer in hand currently, Is this worth to be considered??
Any reply on this is highly appreciable. Thanks.
