{"text": "Education: B.tech Computer Science from Tier 3 college (2017 Grad)\nYears of Experience: 3 years 6 months\nPrior Experience: Unicorn Startup(current, non india) (2 unicorn startups, indian)\nDate of the Offer: 1 September 2020\nCompany: Hotstar\nTitle/Level: Software Development Engineer 2\nLocation: Gurgaon\nSalary: 32,40,000\nRelocation/Signing Bonus: 2,00,000\nStock bonus: 0\nBonus: 3,60,000\nTotal comp (Salary + Bonus + Stock): 36,00,000\nBenefits: No such benefits as such\nCurrent compensation:- 2750000(2450000 Base + 100000 Benefits) + Yearly bonus(not part of CTC or the compensation I mentioned)\nOther Details:- I haven't accepted the offer yet, waiting for some more interviews.\nWhat do you guys think should I make this switch?\nConsidering that in my current organization there is nothing bad its all chilled out, I mainly started looking out as the works is more like that of an SRE and I was and am interested in core backend development. Otherwise I don't see any cons, people are knowledgable and chilled and are concerned about work getting done and not the hours you sit(had some prior experience like this). Also in terms of WFH and flexiblity the organization is pretty chilled out. And people who have been here for 3-4 years have really grown in ladders.\nThe benefit I see in Hotstar is their stack is JAVA which I haven't worked in previously and I believe many companies are still mostly JAVA based. The compensation seems okay and HR told me that some Disney stocks may get included later on(no guarentee). And scale seems really good. This may help in future.\nIs the compensation good enough?\nDoes the compensation seem good enough to make a switch, considering after taxes?"}
