Edit 1:
I knew this was a lowball. I didn't care about the money they offered unless its not too low due to one reason- The amount of opportunities I will get in future as an SDE in Ola vs the opportunities I get as a System Engineer in TCS. I was eventually right as I was able to easily fetch interview calls from companies like Adobe, Amazon, Walmart, Intuit, Zomato, Oracle OCI, Groww etc even during the hiring freeze season while I was working in Ola without applying explicitly in some cases.
When I was in TCS, it was damn hard to fetch interviews even when it was the hiring season (2021 end).
