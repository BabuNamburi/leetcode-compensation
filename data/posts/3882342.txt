Hi Leetcode,
Need help in determining which company to choose from Gojek and Sharechat.
YOE - 2yrs
Current Compensation - 18LPA base + 2LPA bonus = 20LPA
New Compensation details:
Sharechat SDE 1 - (Cash component + stocks over 4 years) = 30 +14 = 44LPA (other benefits over and above this like insurances and relocation etc)
Gojek L2- (Cash component) = 30LPA (No RSUs . Other benefits over and above this like insurances and relocation etc)
Dealbreakers for me:
Work culture - Have heard gojek culture is not the same since IPO.
Stability - Sharechat is at the risk of another layoff.
work life balance
Compensation is the same in both apart from the stocks part which for me is not much of a dealbreaker. so now it comes down to work and the culture.
Wanted to know from the community if recently someone knows about the culture and work life balance at these companies.
Thanks in advance.
