Hi there,
I have a question on Sr or IC roles for data scientist. How much you think is the max out for such role in total compensation if you are hired by a NON-FANG company? Do I need to hire by a FANG company to have a highest salary? Can I work in a NON-FANG company and still earn as much as someone who is working in a FANG company?
